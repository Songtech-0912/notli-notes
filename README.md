# Notli Notes

 Preparing for exams? You'll find help here.

Everyone knows the craziness of exam time - suddenly, you're dying to find revision books you've never bothered to read, and you can't go without a day without your notebook. But what if you lose your notebook? What if your notes go missing? You forgot to take notes on an important topic? It's easy to panic if that happens - it's happened to me many times before.

That's why I've decided to digitize all of my notebooks and school notes. Just like the open-source community and the open design movement, I've decided to make all of my notes free to use and modify. Hopefully, once others benefit from these notes, they can also contribute to the notes on their own.

*Note: Exam Reference Sheets has a new name: Notli! It will take some time to rename everything! So please be patient with me during this process!*

## Quick Start

Currently, notes are available for the following subjects:

- [Honors Chemistry](src/Honors-Chemistry-Reference.md)
- [AP US History](src/AP-US-History-Reference.md)
- [Honors Algebra](src/Honors-Algebra-Reference.md)
- [AP Lang & Composition](src/AP-Lang+Composition-Reference.md)

âš  Note that many of these notes are still incomplete due to lapses in development.

Read the notes by going to <https://songtech-0912.github.io/Exam-Reference-Sheets/>. They can be downloaded as Markdown files (with the `.md` extension) and viewed offline as well. 

## Download

You can download these notes as PDFs if you wish.

> This will be implemented soon, but you can't right now

## Roadmap/Work in progress

- [x] Display formulas properly with Mathjax
  - Currently all LaTeX formulas are displayed verbatim as $$s which look horrible, which is why this is neccesary
- [x] Host the notes online with a website
- [x] Integrate TailwindCSS Typography to make notes look nice
- [ ] Switch to KaTeX for correct chemical/mathematical equation rendering; currently work-in-progress
- [ ] Auto-format Markdown and HTML code with Prettier
- [ ] Full documentation on how to edit, modify or use GitHub with notes
- [ ] Publish PDF versions in GitHub Releases
- [ ] Include a search bar to easily find key terms in each of the notes
- [ ] Improve UI of website and do redesign

## Contribution

Contribution is really simple. You just need two things: a bit of time, and a text editor.

Firstly, **before you do anything**, read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It should take no more than 3 minutes. 

Next, start editing and writing! These notes are written in Markdown, which is very easy and fast to write, and can use a lot of themes. I personally use the [stackedit](https://stackedit.io) editor to edit these notes. Use whatever you see fit.

Remember that any contribution falls under the project's [license](LICENSE.md), to ensure that the project can remain free and open-source for all.
