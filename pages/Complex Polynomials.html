        <h1>Complex Polynomials</h1>
<h2>What are imaginary and complex numbers?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We know that there is no real number $x$ that can be squared to produce $-1$</li>
<li>So mathematicians created an expanded system of numbers using the <strong>imaginary unit</strong> $i$, where $i = \sqrt{-1}$</li>
<li>This means that $i^2 = -1$</li>
<li>A <strong>complex number</strong> is a quadratic in the standard form $a + bi$, where $bi$ is the imaginary part and $a$ is the real part</li>
<li>A <em>pair</em> of complex numbers $(a + bi)(a - bi)$ form a <strong>complex conjugate</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding, subtracting, and multiplying complex number</h3>
<p>Complex numbers can be added and subtracted like normal algebraic expressions.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>Express $\sqrt{-100}$ as an imaginary number
<ul>
<li>$\sqrt{-100}$ can be simplified to $\sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{100}$</li>
<li>This would result in $i \sqrt{100}$ which simplifies to $10i$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solve $(3 - 5i)(3 + 5i)$
<ul>
<li>$(3 - 5i)(3 + 5i)$ can be simplified to $3^2 - 25i^2$</li>
<li>Because $i^2=-1$, this would result in $9 + (25 * -1)$ which would be $34$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Find the conjugate</h2>
<ul>
<li>The conjugate is formed by switching the signs of a complex number $(a + bi)$ into $(a - bi)$</li>
<li>For example, the complex number $(3 + 5i)$ would have the conjugate $(3-5i)$</li>
<li>If the complex number is purely imaginary (like $5i$ or $-20i$), remember that these are basically in the form $(0 \pm i)$
<ul>
<li>For instance, $5i$ is actually $(0 + 5i)$</li>
<li>So its conjugate would be $(0 - 5i)$ which would be $-5i$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conjugates are very useful in simplifying division of complex numbers, because any complex number multiplied by its conjugate results in a real number</li>
</ul>
<h2>Powers of $i$</h2>
<p>The powers of $i$ fulfill a cyclic pattern of $(i, -1, -i, 1)$:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Power of $i$</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>$i^1$</td><td>$i$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$i^2$</td><td>$-1$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$i^3$</td><td>$-i$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$i^4$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$i^5$</td><td>$i$ <em>same as</em> $i^1$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$i^6$</td><td>$-1$ <em>same as</em> $i^2$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$i^7$</td><td>$-i$ <em>same as</em> $i^3$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$i^8$</td><td>$1$ <em>same as</em> $i^4$</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>We can also notice a certain pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even exponents are always imaginary</li>
<li>Odd exponents are always real</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows us to find arbitrary exponents of $i$:</p>
<ul>
<li>$i^{60}$ = $(i^4)^{15}$ = $1^{15}$ = $1$</li>
<li>$i^{15}$ = $(i^4)^3 \cdot i^3$ = $1 \cdot -i$ = $-i$</li>
</ul>
<h3>SImplifying using powers of $i$</h3>
<p>Suppose we have $i^{49}$. How could we simplify it?</p>
<p>Well, remember that $n^{a+b} = n^a \cdot n^b$. So, we could write $i^{49}$ as $i^{48 \cdot 1}$, which simplifies to $i^{48} + i^1$. We know that $i^{48} = (i^4)^{12}$, and $i^4 = 1$, so $(i^4)^{12}=1^{12} = 1$. So, $i^{48}=1$.</p>
<p>Now,  since we know $i^{48}=1$, then $i^{48} \cdot i^1 = 1 \cdot i = i$. That means that $i^{49} = i$.</p>
<h2>Rationalizing a complex denominator</h2>
<h3>Using $i$</h3>
<p>When our denominator is a <strong>pure imaginary number</strong>, we can rationalize it by multiplying the it with $\frac{i}{i}$. Because $\frac{i}{i}$ is equal to 1, we get the same fraction, but with a rational denominator.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we wanted to rationalize the fraction $\frac{3}{i}$. We would multiply it by $\frac{i}{i}$, which gives this:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{3}{i} \cdot \frac{i}{i} = \frac{3i}{i^2} = \frac{3i}{-1} = -3i
$$</p>
<h3>Using the conjugate</h3>
<p>When our denominator is a <strong>complex number</strong> with both a real part and an imaginary part, we can rationalize it by using its complex conjugate. To do this, we multiply the conjugate $a + bi$ by its conjugate $\frac{a - bi}{a - bi}$.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we wanted to rationalize the fraction $\frac{3}{5+2i}$. We know that the conjugate of $(5 + 2i)$ is $(5-2i)$, so:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{3}{5 + 2i} \cdot \frac{5-2i}{5-2i} = \frac{15-6i}{25-4i^2} = \frac{15-6i}{25+4} = \frac{15-6i}{29}
$$</p>
<h2>Finding the Zeros of a Polynomial Function</h2>
<p>Depending on the question you're given, there are multiple ways of finding the zero of a polynomial function. However, some general rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every zero $n$ means that one of the polynomial's factors is $(x-n)$</li>
<li>A polynomial cannot have any more zeroes than its degree (for instance, $ax^2 + bx + c$ has at most 2 zeroes)</li>
<li>Look for special polynomial patterns (e.g. sum/difference of cubes, perfect square trinomials) to simplify the process</li>
<li>If all else fails, and you have a trinomial, remember that you can always count on the quadratic formula</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding zeros using factor by grouping</h3>
<p>Let's say we have the equation $5 v^{3}-2 v^{2}+25 v-10=0$. We know that cube roots don't work with the quadratic formula, so what can we do? The first thing you should <em>always</em> try is to factor the polynomial.</p>
<p>In our case, we can factor $5 v^{3}-2 v^{2}+25 v-10$ to $v^2(5v-2)+5(5v-2)$. We can simply take the common factors to end up with $(v^2+5)(5v-2)$. Thus, we can finally solve our equation. If $v^2+5 = 0$, then $v^2 = -5$, and $v = -\sqrt{5i}$. If $5v-2=0$, then $v = \frac{2}{5}$.</p>
<h3>Finding zeros using sum/difference of cubes</h3>
<p>Suppose we have the equation $(x^3 - 8) = 0$. We could then use the difference of cubes to solve it.</p>
<p>Remember that the sum of cubes $a^3 + b^3$ is $(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$, and the difference of cubes $a^3 - b^3$ is $(a - b)(a^2 + ab - b^2)$. Here, we can put our expression in the form of $a^3 - b^3$ because we know that 8 is a perfect cube. Thus, $x^3 - 8$ would be $(x^3 - 2^3)$, where $a = x$ and $b = 2$.</p>
<p>Now, we just have to substitute our $a$ and $b$ into the difference of cubes template equation. It gives us $x^3 - 2^3 = (x-2)(x^2 +2x - 4)$. Because we know that $(x-2)(x^2 + 2x -4) = 0$, we can solve the 2 parts to get the final value of $x$.</p>
<h3>Finding zeros using quadratic formula</h3>
<p>We can use the quadratic formula to solve quadratic equations that simplify to an imaginary or complex number. For example, let's try to solve the equation $x^2 + 3x +8 = 0$. The equation is not factorable, so we have to use the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>Let's first get our $a$, $b$, and $c$ values. In our case, $a = 1, b = 3, c = 8$. Now, we can plug them into the formula:</p>
<p>$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 8}}{2 \cdot 1}
$$</p>
<p>$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 32}}{2 \cdot 1}
$$</p>
<p>$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{-23}}{2}
$$</p>
<p>Our zeroes will therefore be $\frac{-3 + \sqrt{-23}}{2}$ and $\frac{-3 - \sqrt{-23}}{2}$.</p>
<h3>Finding zeros using synthetic division</h3>
<p>You might be asked to determine whether 1 is a zero of  the polynomial $x^3 - 1$. We could do this using the difference of cubes, but let's try using synthetic division instead.</p>
<p>We know that if 1 <em>is</em> a real zero of $x^3-1$, then $(x-1)$ must be one of its real factors. And when we do $x^3 - 1 \div (x-1)$, if the remainder is zero, then our resulting quotient is a factor too.</p>
<p>To set up our synthetic division, we need to get our $c$ value from our divisor $(x-c)$. Here, since it is $(x-1)$, $c = 1$. Let's put that on the left hand side of our synthetic division bar. On the right side is our dividend $x^3 -1$, or more percisely $\underline{1}x^3 + \underline{0}x^2 + \underline{0}x \underline{- 1}$.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{array}{cc}
{
\begin{array}{r}\
1 \
\end{array}
}&amp;
{
\begin{array}{|rrrr}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \ &amp;&amp; &amp; \ \hline
\end{array}
}
\end{array}
$$</p>
<p>And our solution? This:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{array}{cc}
\begin{array}{c} \ 1 \ \ \end{array}
&amp;
\begin{array}{|rrrr}<br />
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \
\downarrow  &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \
\hline 
1(x^2) &amp; 1(x) &amp; 1(x) &amp; R:0 
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$</p>
<p>This means that our equation $(x^3-1)$ has two factors, and they are $(x-1)$ and $x^2 + x +1$. Simplifying $x-1$ gives us the first zero of 1. Simplifying $x^2 + x + 1$ is more complex since it results in a complex number of $\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2}$, which is still a zero, just not a real one.</p>
<p>If you're asked to only provide the real zeroes, then you only need to write the zero of 1. However, you you're asked to provide both real <em>and</em> imaginary zeroes, then the full list of zeroes would be ${1, \frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}, \frac{-1 - \sqrt{-3}}{2}}$</p>
