        <h1>Political Systems, Regimes, and Governments</h1>
<h2>Before starting...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep an open mind before doing AP comparative gov</li>
<li>Remember that there are multiple sides to a story, and there is a danger to telling a singular story</li>
<li>Don't be too pessimistic! There are stories of success in the stories of failure!</li>
<li>This is a course on distinct nations, but don't forget that whatever the state of these countries</li>
</ul>
<h2>Classifying nations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Several measurements can be used to measure the growth and development of nations, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human development index</strong> (HDI) - economic and social</li>
<li><strong>Freedom house score</strong> (FH) - political</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Factors used in evaluation
<ul>
<li>Electoral process</li>
<li>Political participation</li>
<li>Functioning of government (fiscal responsibility, regulatory efforts, open markets, transparency or corruption)</li>
<li>Freedom of Expression and Belief</li>
<li>Association/Organization Rights</li>
<li>Rule of Law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political systems</strong> comprise the laws, ideas, and procedures that decide what government is and what government does</li>
<li><strong>States</strong> are political institutions that combine a permanent population with governing institutiotns that exercise control over an internationally-recognized territory</li>
<li>A <strong>nation</strong> is a non-concrete group formed by people with common identities
<ul>
<li>A state <em>can</em> have a national identity, but there are nations that are not a state, and states can include multiple nations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>regime</strong> is the fundamental rules decide how power exercises
<ul>
<li>Regime change is a change in the style of the government</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong> is the set of institutions or individuals legally empowered to make binding decisions for a state</li>
<li><strong>Sovereignty</strong> is the right to self-rule</li>
</ul>
<h3>A study of political systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>China's political system is an <strong>authoritarian regime</strong></li>
<li>Iran's political systems is a <strong>theocracy</strong> with semi-democratic elements</li>
<li>Nigeria's political system has existed as a constitutional presidential democracy with a federal system since 1999</li>
<li>Mexico's political system has existed as a constitutional presidential democracy since 1917</li>
<li>Russia's political system is theoretically a federalist democracy but has authoritarian elements</li>
<li>The UK is technically a constitutional monarchy but a democracy in practice, with no separation of power</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nations vs. States</h3>
<h4>Addressing nations and ethnic minorities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Countries can deal with nationalist movements and separatist movements in several ways</li>
<li>War/suppression of dissent/violence/ethnic cleansing</li>
<li>Assimilation</li>
<li>Vote/referendum on independence</li>
<li>Devolution/granting partial autonomy/federalism</li>
<li>Allow for self-rule/representation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Democracy</h2>
<h3>Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Democracy</strong> or <strong>authoritarianism</strong> of states can be determined by:
<ul>
<li>Rule of law - is the state governed by law or by arbritrary decree?</li>
<li><strong>Government transparency</strong> - do the citizens know what the government is doing? </li>
<li><strong>Free and fair elections</strong> - are elections competitive and opposition parties able to have a chance?</li>
<li><strong>Independence of government branches</strong> - is one branch able to control all government power?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of democracy
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated democracies</strong> are fully democratic and have established democracies in such a way that they are unlikely to become undemocratic</li>
<li><strong>Transitional democracies</strong> are democratic but still need democratic improvement</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid regimes</strong> have some democratic elements but are generally undemocratic</li>
<li><strong>Iliberal democracies</strong> and <strong>hybrid regimes</strong> are states that hold elections from time to time with little competition toward the ruling party</li>
<li><strong>One party states</strong> prevent any other party from competing in elections</li>
<li><strong>Theocracies</strong> require the state be controlled by leaders of a particular religion (Iran)</li>
<li><strong>Totalitarian governments</strong> severely limit citizens’ rights to movement and free choice of employment</li>
<li><strong>Military regimes</strong> are when military leaders hold top positions of governing authority (common in Nigeria from independence through 1999 constitution)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power, Authority, and Legitimacy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power</strong> is the ability of someone to make other(s) do something
<ul>
<li>Can be negative e.g. by intimidation, bribery or positive e.g. by respect, popularity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Authority</strong> is the right for someone to do something</li>
<li><strong>Legitimacy</strong> is when the people feel the government has a right to use power in the way they do
<ul>
<li>Legitimacy can increase the power of a regime and government</li>
<li>Restoring legitimacy in a country is a primary objective of a country's leaders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sources of Power and Authority</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some countries base their power and authority from a Constitution and the consent of the governed (e.g. holding popular elections)</li>
<li>Others base their power from different means:
<ul>
<li>Endorsement of the dominant political party - e.g. China, Russia</li>
<li>Religion - e.g. Iran</li>
<li>The military - e.g. Nigeria</li>
<li>Nationalism - e.g. Russia</li>
<li>Tradition and institution - e.g. the UK</li>
<li>Government effectiveness and economic growth - e.g. 1970s China</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The more tumultuous a country's history, the more likely a country is to favor strong (and possibly authoritarian) leaders</li>
<li>Transitions of power can affect power and authority
<ul>
<li>Peaceful transitions of power e.g. in elections</li>
<li>The political elite's backing of a strong president in Russia, creating a &quot;managed democracy&quot; with election rules favoring one party</li>
<li>The UK's constitutional reforms and devolution to allow local and regional parliaments to hold some amount of power</li>
<li>Coup/coup d'etat: a forcible takeover of governing power</li>
<li>Revolution: the removal and long-term replacement of a form of government, e.g. in Mexico (1910), Russia (1917), China (1949), Iran (1979)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sustaining Legitimacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Asserting power abroad (e.g. Russia posting troops near Ukraine, US invading Iraq, etc.)</li>
<li>Holding popular elections</li>
<li>Governmental effectiveness</li>
<li>Economic growth</li>
<li>The endorsement</li>
<li>Religious/nationalist heritage</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specific sources of legitimacy for countries</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Source of Legitimacy</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>China</td><td>Popular revolution, tradition, economic growth, nationalism</td></tr>
<tr><td>Iran</td><td>Popular revolution, Shia Islam</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mexico</td><td>Popular revoluion, Constitution, popular elections</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nigeria</td><td>Independence, Constitution, popular elections</td></tr>
<tr><td>Russia</td><td>Nationalism</td></tr>
<tr><td>UK</td><td>Tradition, stability, popular elections</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Challenges to Legitimacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increase in corruption, reduced electoral competition</li>
<li>Serious problems (economic issues, social conflicts, terrorism, natural disasters) and <em>especially</em> mismanaged responses to crises</li>
</ul>
<h2>Devolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Devolution is the <strong>spreading out of power</strong> to regional governments</li>
<li>This is a double-edged sword:
<ul>
<li>Can promote policy innovation and allow policies to match local needs, increasing legitimacy</li>
<li>Can also introduce contradictory policy or perpetuate inequality, decreasing legitimacy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Federal States</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federal states constitutionally divide power among different levels of government (federalism) to confer a degree of local autonomy</li>
<li>But they also reserve some powers for the national government</li>
<li>Examples: Mexico, Nigeria, Russia</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mexican Federalism</h4>
<ul>
<li>32 states including Mexico City</li>
<li>Strong central government</li>
<li>Policies (e.g. legal status of abortion) can vary between states</li>
</ul>
<h4>Nigerian Federalism</h4>
<ul>
<li>36 states</li>
<li>Also strong central government</li>
<li>12 northern states are very rural and Muslim</li>
<li>But these states are also where oil is located</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unitary States</h3>
<ul>
<li>Concentrate power at the national level, with more uniform policies and potentially more efficient policy-making
<ul>
<li>Districts have functions but do not have policy-making ability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>E.g. China, Iran, the UK</li>
<li>Unitary doesn't necessarily mean authoritarian</li>
<li>(The UK has no constitutional guarantee of devolving power to regional governments, that's why we consider it unitary)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in Allocations of Power</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although Russia's constitution establishes federalism with protected powers of regional governments, Putin has centralized power in the name of national security
<ul>
<li>Why does Putin do this?</li>
<li>Because its eastern regions (Chechnya) who are fighting for independence are also its most oil-rich regions, and essential to the Russian economy</li>
<li>And bolstering the economy gives the Russian central government (and Putin) legitimacy and power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>China is a unitary government but has autonomous regions (Tibet and Xinjian) and constitutional protections of ethnic minorities but the central government maintains its sovereignty in those regions</li>
<li>China also has special administrative regions (SARs) in Hong Kong and Macau which gives both significant political autonomy</li>
</ul>
<h2>In Detail: Putin</h2>
<h3>Overview of Putin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Early 1990s Russia was an experiment in democracy, Boris Yeltsin (progressive politician) tries to fully democratize Russia</li>
<li>Yeltsin in 1999 - asks people for forgiveness, feels he has failed to do a good job as president, decided to resign and let Putin take the presidency</li>
<li>Putin - tries to be the anti-Yeltsin, cold, indifferent, dominating, strong, dignified leader</li>
<li>Clinton warns Yeltsin - <em>&quot;This young man...he doesn't have democracy in his heart&quot;</em></li>
<li>Later Yeltsin regretted his choice of successor in Putin</li>
<li>Putin's first few months
  - Solidify his power and make himself known and feared
  - Wanted to &quot;make Russia great again&quot; after Russia's humiliation by the US (or so he perceived)
  - Putin sees the US as a threat to the stability of his regime, and thinks the US wants to overthrow him.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Putin's resentment of the US</h3>
<p><em>Note to self: clean this part!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>He was trained in the KGB (wanted to be a secret agent all his life), which drilled the officers with an anti-US ideology</li>
<li>Placed counterintelligence operations</li>
<li>But was very disappointed when he was assigned to a post in Dresden in East Germany - a backwater in the Soviet Union</li>
<li>There he observed the fall of the Berlin Wall - marks the waning power of the USSR, and a horrifying event to Putin
  - His world was crumbling before his eyes
  - Waning power of the USSR compared to the rising power of the US aggrieved Putin, reinforced his feelings</li>
<li>Putin was confronting a crowd of protestors that were demonstrating at the KGB building where he was stationed
  - He calls Moscow, Moscow doesn't respond
  - This is a massive, massive trauma for him, because soviet influence is collapsing before his eyes, and the country he felt pride for was close to destruction</li>
<li>To Putin, the end of the USSR was a humiliation, caused by the US
  - In his own words &quot;the collapse of the USSR was the greatest geopoltical catastrophe of the century&quot;</li>
<li>He returned to the new Russia, becoming a political operative and a bureaucrat
  - Rises through the ranks working in the Kremlin
  - Gets to know Yeltsin
  - Becomes new head of the FSB (federal security service, basically the intelligence service of Russia)
  - Convinces (essentially lied to) Yeltsin that he shared his democratic goals</li>
<li>Less than 1 month into his tenure as prime minister of Russia, there are the bombings in Chechnya
  - Putin goes on national television and outlines an aggressive strategy for hunting the terrorists
  - He orders military intervention to crush the Chechen separatists and goes down to the ground to observe troops
  - He is seen by the Russian public as a man of action</li>
<li>He becomes president of Russia when Yeltsin resigns and immediately begins to consolidate power
  - Putin crushes opposition media outlets
  - He makes sure RT (the main state-run news agency watched by the majority of Russians) portrayed him well
  - In foreign policy, he courts the new Republican President George W. Bush
  - He knew that President Bush was very religious, and so he relates to him over religion to win him over
  - But then came 9/11, and Bush's presidency was transformed
  - Bush would respond with an anti-terrorism, pro-democracy message
  - In Iraq, Bush championed regime change and made it his mission to spread democracy worldwide with US military force and might, echoing its actions in the final days of the USSR</li>
<li>Putin knows from Iraq that at some point, regime change will come to him too
  - It becomes his greatest fear and an existential threat
  - He concluded that the US would eventually use its power and leverage to depose any leader they didn't agree with, including Putin</li>
<li>So Putin starts spreading an anti-American message
  - He becomes the person portrayed as &quot;standing up&quot; to the US to the Russian people</li>
<li>In 2004, Putin gets his chance
  - Chechen terrorists take 1,100 students and teachers hostage and kill 333 of them, the worst school shooting ever
  - They demanded that Putin either withdraw his troops or they would kill the children
  - Putin deploys the army and shells the school with flamethrowers and artillery, causing massive fires and explosions, and leaving hundreds of children dead
  - There was massive domestic outrage against Putin
  - But in Putin's announcement, he blamed the West for supporting the Chechen terrorists and diverts responsibility
  - He used the threat of the US to justify more consolidation of power, including cancelling elections and firing dissenting politicians</li>
<li>In the later half of the mid-2000s, popular democracy movements (so-called &quot;color revolutions&quot;) spread throughout former Soviet republics in Europe
  - Putin thought that these movements were sparked by America in their push to export democracy around the world
  - And he concluded that these were efforts by the US to install anti-Russian and pro-American regimes under the veneer of democracy
  - Most of all, he feared Russia was next in line for revolution
    - And if there is a revolution in Russia, then Putin fears he will be overthrown, too
  - Of course, the allegations of US involvement were completely unfounded (Washington has never sought to overthrow him), but to Putin, they just vindicated his belief that the US was an enemy
  - To Putin, enough was enough, and he started to plan his revenge</li>
<li>At the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Putin agggressively bashes Western leaders for the US's &quot;almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations&quot;
  - This was a turning point for Putin
  - He showed his true colors
  - He was basically saying, &quot;we aren't going to even try anymore, from now on, the US will abide by our rules&quot;
  - The Bush administration could do nothing to turn Putin back</li>
<li>In 2008, Obama became president
  - Obama wished to build a constructive relationship with Putin with his new foreign policy
  - He initiated a &quot;reset&quot; of Russian-American relations</li>
<li>In 2009 Obama personally came over to Russia for a visit
So everything Putin does is out of revenge for the US
  - Putin spoke to Obama with an &quot;airing of grievances&quot; - essentially complaining about everything he doesn't like about the US
  - Obama is very clear that Putin is (in his mind) locked in the past and won't accept being a partner of the US
  - Putin eventually came to believe that Obama was just as bad as the previous US presidents
  - He is vindicated by the Arab Spring, which is (to him) like experiencing the Dresden demonstrations of 1989 again
  - He sees it as the American meddling in the internal affairs of other countries to the detriment of Russia
  - And Putin saw the Arab Spring as something that could happen to Russia and could personally happen to him</li>
<li>By 2011, protests against Putin began
  - The largest demonstration in Russa since 1991
  - The protests were against mass-scale electoral fraud in the 2011 elections
  - Putin sees American regime change coming to Russia
  - And he blames it on Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, who was outspokenly in favor of the protestors
  - Putin claimed that behind the scenes, Clinton was funding the Russian opposition and sparked the protests
  - He ordered a crackdown on the protests
  - And from that point on he remembers Clinton as an adversary and personally wishes to exact revenge on her
  - In Putin's mind, he was defending Russia's (and his own) survival against the US</li>
</ul>
