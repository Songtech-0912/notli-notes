        <h1>Rational Expressions</h1>
<h2>Domain of a Rational Expression</h2>
<ul>
<li>A rational expression in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ would have a limited domain because $b \neq 0$</li>
<li>For example, $\frac{2x+1}{3-x}$ would have the domain $(-\infty, 3)\cup(3, \infty)$ because if $x=3$, then the denominator is 0, which is undefined</li>
<li>Also, a rational expression in the form $\sqrt{a}$ has a limited domain because $a \geq 0$</li>
<li>For example, $\sqrt{5x +2}$ would have the domain $(-\frac{5}{2}, 0)$</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simplifying a rational expression</h2>
<ul>
<li>The distributive property can be used to simplify a rational expressions</li>
<li>Factor out a rational expression completely, and then you can divide out by the common factors</li>
<li>Remember that $\frac{a + b}{c} \neq \frac{a \cdot b}{c}$, so don't make the mistake of dividing by terms!</li>
<li>Finally, look out for any domain restrictions (e.g. square root, zero division)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dividing Rational Expressions</h2>
<p>E.g. </p>
<p>$$\frac{x^3-8}{x^2-4}$$</p>
<h2>Subtracting Rational Expressions</h2>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>$$
\frac{2}{x+1} + \frac{2}{x-1} + \frac{1}{x^2-1}
$$</p>
<h2>Rational Functions</h2>
<p>A <strong>rational function</strong> is a function that <em>can be</em> in the standard form:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{N(x)}{D(x)}
$$</p>
<p>where $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ are polynomials and $D(x)$ is not the zero polynomial.</p>
<p>Note that rational functions are <em>not</em> necessarily given to you in this form, but you can convert any rational function to this form.</p>
<h3>Finding all of the zeroes of a rational function</h3>
<p>Let's say you were given this rational function and were asked to find its zeroes: </p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x^2-2x-3}
$$</p>
<p>To do so, we have to set $f(x) = 0$. So we have:</p>
<p>$$
0 = \frac{x^2-1}{x^2-2x-3}
$$</p>
<p>$$
0 = x^2-1
$$</p>
<p>$$
0 = x^2-1
$$</p>
<p>$$
x = 1, x = -1
$$</p>
<p>But that's not all! We have to check for <em>domain restrictions</em>. Remember, in a rational function, the denominator cannot equal zero. So, that means:</p>
<p>$$
x^2 -2x -3 \neq 0
$$</p>
<p>$$
(x+1)(x-3) \neq 0
$$</p>
<p>$$
x \neq -1, x \neq 3
$$</p>
<p>That means that of our two <em>possible</em> zeroes, $1$ and $-1$, there is only one actual zero, because $x \neq -1$.</p>
<p>So, we have our answer! The (only) zero is 1.</p>
<h3>Asymptotes of Rational Functions</h3>
<p>We find the <strong>vertical asymptote</strong> using our denominator, since we know that the denominator cannot be equal to zero. For instance, if we have a rational function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$, we know that $x^2 \neq 0$. Solving that gives us $\pm x \neq 0$.</p>
<p>Because $x$ cannot be <em>exactly</em> zero, but can be <em>very close</em> to zero, we have an asymptote - a line that the rational function never touches. In our case, the vertical asymptote is the line $x = 0$, because $f(x)$ can never be zero.</p>
<p>We find the <strong>horizontal asymptote</strong> using the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator as a fraction. For example, let's take the rational function $g(x) = \frac{2x}{x + 1}$. The leading coefficient of the <em>numerator's</em> first term $2x$ is $2$. The leading coefficient of the <em>denominator's</em> first term $1x$ is $1$.</p>
<p>Our horizontal asymptote is the <strong>numerator's coefficient divided by the denominator's coefficient</strong>. That means it is equal to $\frac{2}{1} = 2$. So our horizontal asymptote is the line $y = 2$.</p>
<p>But what if our rational function has a numerator and denominator of differing degrees? Let's take $h(x) = \frac{x}{x^3 + 3x}$ as an example. The numerator's first term $x$ is of degree 1, but the denominator's first term $x^3$ is of degree 3. So what do we do?</p>
<p>The solution is to add a zeroed placeholder term to the numerator. Remember that our function $h(x) = \frac{x}{x^3 + 3x}$ can also be written out like this:</p>
<p>$$
h(x) = \frac{0x^3 + 0x^2 + x}{x^3 + 3x}
$$</p>
<p>That's now much easier! Once we equalize the degrees, we can use our normal formula. The numerator's first term's coefficient is $0$, and the denominator's first term's coefficient is $1$. So our horizontal asymptote is $\frac{0}{1} = 0$, which means it's the line $y = 0$.</p>
<p>If a rational function has <strong>no vertical asymptote</strong>, we say that it is <em>continuous</em>. Otherwise, we say that it is <em>non-continuous</em>.</p>
<h3>Holes in Rational Functions</h3>
<p><strong>Holes</strong>, technically called <em>points of discontinuity</em>, are undefined points on the graph of a rational function. We show them on the graph of a rational function as open circles, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.onlinemath4all.c./images/holeofafunction1.png" alt="Example graph with hole" /></p>
<p>To understand why a hole exists, let's consider a very basic rational function with a hole:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{x}{x^2}
$$</p>
<p>What would happen if $x=0$? Well, if we substitute, we get this:</p>
<p>$$
f(0) = \frac{(0)}{(0)^2} = \frac{0}{0} = \ ?
$$</p>
<p>And $\frac{0}{0}$ is undefined. That's why there is a hole, a point that cannot exist in the graph.</p>
<p>A greatest common factor cancellation gives us the holes of a rational function. To understand what this means, let's try to find the holes of a basic rational function $f(x)$:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x+1}
$$</p>
<p>So how do we know that $f(x)$ has a hole? The answer lies in its <em>factors</em>. When a rational function has a <strong>common factor</strong> in both its numerator and denominator, then it must have a hole.</p>
<p>When we simplify $f(x)$ like this:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x+1} =\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x+1}
$$</p>
<p>We see that the factor $(x+1)$ in both its numerator (top) and denominator (bottom). So it has a hole. But where is that hole?</p>
<p>The x-coordinate of the hole is found using the <strong>common factor</strong>. In our case, that common factor is $(x+1)$. If we solve the equation $x+1 = 0$, we find that $x = -1$. That is the x-coordinate of our hole.</p>
<p>The y-coordinate of the hole is found by &quot;plugging in&quot; the hole's x-coordinate into the <em>remainder function</em>. Let's find our remainder function first. To do this, cross out the factor from the original function:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{\cancel{(x+1)}(x-1)}{\cancel{x+1}} $$ </p>
<p>This leaves us with the function $f_{rem.}(x) = x-1$, which is our <strong>remainder function</strong>. If we plug our x-coordinate $x = -1$ into $f_{rem.}(x)$, then we get $y = -2$. This is our y-coordinate. So, we now have the complete set of coordinates for the hole, and we know that the hole was located at $(-1, -2)$.</p>
<p>There is one last important property about holes - since they are points where a rational function is not defined, there are no asymptotes, zero or intercepts possible at the same position as a hole. That means that in our example $f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x+1}$, even if it had an asymptote of $x=-1$ or an intercept, say, at $(-1, 3)$, these <strong>would not exist</strong> because of the hole at $(-1, -2)$! The hole reigns absolute when finding the graph of a rational function!</p>
<h3>Intercepts of Rational Functions</h3>
<p>To find the intercepts, we use the same technique as we use to find the intercepts for any other type of function.</p>
<p>To find x-intercepts, we simply set $f(x) = 0$. To find y-intercepts, we simply set $x = 0$. Let's see how this works in practice, by finding the intercepts of the rational function $f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x-4}$.</p>
<p>Let's find the x-intercept first. We know that we can find the x-intercept by setting $f(x) = 0$. So let's substitute that in:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x-4}
$$</p>
<p>$$
0 = \frac{x+1}{x-4}
$$</p>
<p>Now, we can just solve algebraically:</p>
<p>$$
0(x-4) = x+1
$$</p>
<p>$$
0 = x+1
$$</p>
<p>$$
x = -1
$$</p>
<p>This gives us the <strong>x-intercept</strong> of $(-1, 0)$. Now, let's find the y-intercept by setting $x = 0$:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{(0)+1}{(0)-4}
$$</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = -\frac{1}{4}
$$</p>
<p>This gives us the <strong>y-intercept</strong> of $(0, -\frac{1}{4})$.</p>
<p>However, we're not done yet! Rational function intercepts have a special property - they often have <em>restricted values</em>. If the rational function has asymptotes or holes, then they <strong>cannot</strong> be an intercept! So, let's check our solution for $f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x-4}$ for restricted values.</p>
<p>The vertical asymptote of $f(x)$ is $x = 4$. Our x-intercept is $(-1, 0)$, which is different, so this doesn't affect it. The horizontal asymptote of $f(x)$ is $y = 1$. Our y-intercept is $(0, -\frac{1}{4})$, which is different too, so this doesn't affect it either. There are also no holes, so they don't affect the intercepts.</p>
<p>So there you have it - the intercepts of the function $f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x-4}$ are $(-1, 0)$ (for $x$) and $(0, -\frac{1}{4})$ (for $y$), and none of them are subject to restricted values!</p>
<h3>Domain and Range of Rational Functions</h3>
<p>Now that we know the holes and asymptotes, we can find the domain and range.</p>
<p>Remember, since the vertical asymptote is a value $x$ can never reach, it is a <em>domain restriction</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, since the horizontal asymptote is a value $y$ can never reach, it is a <em>range restriction</em>.</p>
