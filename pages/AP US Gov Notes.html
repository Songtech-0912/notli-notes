        <h1>AP US Government Notes</h1>
<p><em>Unofficial crash-dive into US government and politics, collected from my AP Gov notes</em></p>
<h2>Foundations of American Democracy</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are a <em>republic</em> - a representative democratic system</li>
<li>Our system of government is one that:
<ul>
<li>Balances between civil liberties and security</li>
<li>Practices <em>limited</em> government
<ul>
<li>Federalism</li>
<li>Checks and Balances/Separation of Powers</li>
<li>Bill of Rights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provides representation to its citizens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How did we get there?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Fathers of the Theory of Government</h2>
<h3>Thomas Hobbs</h3>
<ul>
<li>English enlightenment philosopher</li>
<li>The predominant form of government during his time were <strong>absolute monarchies</strong></li>
<li>Popularized the theories of the &quot;Social Contract&quot; and &quot;State of Nature&quot;</li>
<li>The &quot;State of Nature&quot; was a imaginary setting with no government and no laws
<ul>
<li>People in this state are self-interested and selfish</li>
<li>The absence of rights leads to social disorder
<ul>
<li>This leads to a state of anarchy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So people submit naturally to a monarch because they prefer a government instead of an anarchy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hobbs thought people were naturally selfish and they needed an absolute authority to keep people in line</li>
<li>Thus forming the &quot;Social Contract&quot;: people give up rights and freedoms in order to have and gain security
* E.g. Airport security after 9/11
<ul>
<li>Government were set up to protect life, property, and <em>some</em> liberty</li>
<li>The social contract binds us, the people can't leave the social contract (no right to revolt)</li>
<li>Introduces the theme of <strong>civil liberties vs. security</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>John Locke</h3>
<ul>
<li>Another English enlightenment philosopher</li>
<li>Wrote the &quot;Second Treatises of Government&quot;
<ul>
<li>The &quot;State of Nature&quot; is &quot;good and enjoyable&quot;</li>
<li>People are born free and equal with a &quot;blank slate&quot;</li>
<li>People had Natural Rights - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locke's &quot;Social Contract&quot;
<ul>
<li>People give up &quot;some&quot; freedoms to create government to protect property</li>
<li>But Locke advocated for a government with limited powers
<ul>
<li>People need to have natural rights too!</li>
<li>So power should <em>not</em> be given to a monarch, it should be give to a legislature (&quot;government of laws, not of men&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the government fails to uphold its part of the social contract (i.e. becomes tyrannical) then the people have the right to revolt and form a new government</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>lack of representation</strong> creates both a <em>desire</em> and a <em>justification</em> for independence
<ul>
<li>For the Colonies, it was the change of Salutary Neglect after the French and Indian War and the suspension of colonial legislatures in favor of more direct authority that created a sense of not being represented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Governments exist by the <strong>consent of the people</strong> and strive to protect the <strong>natural rights</strong> of the people</li>
</ul>
<h2>Declaration of Independence</h2>
<h3>Listing of Most Important Grievances</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taxation without representation</li>
<li>Cutting off trade to the colonies (Intolerable Acts)</li>
<li>Suspending colonial courts</li>
<li>Hierarchy</li>
<li>Quartering of soldiers</li>
<li>No one is listening to their grievances</li>
</ul>
<h2>From Declaration of Independence to Constitution</h2>
<h5>Weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation</h5>
<ul>
<li>The Articles of Confederation were the first attempt at a constitution
<ul>
<li>They could be roughly described as a treaty uniting a number of sovereign states</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They were enacted during the Revolutionary War as a <em>temporary</em> measure</li>
</ul>
<table><thead><tr><th>Weakness of the Articles of Confederation</th><th>Result/Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Congress had no power to collect taxes</td><td>The government was always short of money</td></tr>
<tr><td>Congress had no power to regulate foreign trade</td><td>Quarrels broke out among states and trading with other countries was difficult</td></tr>
<tr><td>Approval of nine states was needed to enact laws</td><td>It was difficult to enact laws so necessary laws were not enacted</td></tr>
<tr><td>13 states needed to approve amendments to the Articles</td><td>There was no practical way to change the powers of government</td></tr>
<tr><td>The government had no executive branch</td><td>There was no effective way to coordinate the work of government</td></tr>
<tr><td>There was no national court system</td><td>The central government had no way to settle disputes among the states</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4>Strengths of the Articles of Confederation</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is no monarch!</li>
<li>Established a system of government to carry through the American Revolution</li>
<li>Sets the precedence for federalism and separation of power</li>
<li>Responsible for passing the Northwest Ordinance in 1787 (gets rid of slavery in the north)</li>
<li>Creates a way for new states to enter the Union</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shay's Rebellion (1786)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Daniel Shays and other groups of ex-revolutionary war soldiers feared that they would not be paid from military service as Massachusetts was in debt and couldn't pay it
<ul>
<li>They were paid in specie</li>
<li>However, the shops used local currencies and would not accept their specie</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Governor asked Continental Congress to send in troops, but...
<ul>
<li>There was no state militia</li>
<li>Private funds had to be raised for a volunteer army</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proves that the system of government was not working</li>
<li>Leads to <strong>assumption of debt</strong> - the nation collects the debts of all the states</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Constitutional Convention</h2>
<h3>The Framers</h3>
<ul>
<li>55 Delegates, only 39 signed, mostly elites</li>
<li>Adams, Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Adams are not there</li>
<li>No Rhode Island</li>
<li>However, Hamilton and Madison and Franklin were all there</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making Political Philosophy a Reality</h3>
<ul>
<li>State constitutions were used as models because they already had many of these principles:
<ul>
<li>Popular Sovereignty</li>
<li>Limited Government</li>
<li>Checks and Balances</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fears the Framers had:
<ul>
<li>Tyranny of large states over small states</li>
<li>Tyranny of states over federal government</li>
<li>Tyranny of the President/Executive (imperial presidency)</li>
<li>Tyranny of the political influence of the President over courts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What type of government?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Participatory democracy</em> (direct democracy): emphasizes broad participation in politics and civil society
<ul>
<li>Civil rights movements, high voter turnout, referendums/state polls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Pluralist (factional) democracy</em>: recognizes group-based activism by nongovernmental interest groups striving for impact on political decision-making
<ul>
<li>We see that in the two-party system, military-industrial complex, Congress lobby groups like the NRA</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Elite democracy</em>: limited participation in politics and civil society
<ul>
<li>The Bush dynasty, campaign finances, advantage of wealth, electoral college</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issues facing the Constitution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Big states vs. small states
<ul>
<li>Virginia Plan: bicameral legislature with representation based on population, and monetary donations will be needed for the Senate</li>
<li>New Jersey plan: unicameral legislature with representation based on proportional representation</li>
<li>Roger Sherman proposes the <strong>Great Compromise</strong> with a bicameral congress with one using representative and one using proportional representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Election of the President
<ul>
<li>Electoral College is a compromise created to make sure that large and small states are fairly represented</li>
<li>The Framers feared that the people can't be trusted to vote for a president</li>
<li>Each state's popular votes go toward electing &quot;electors&quot; who elect the president</li>
<li>A candidate could win the popular vote but lose the electoral vote</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slavery
<ul>
<li>South felt that their slaves should count towards representation</li>
<li>North felt that it was unfair</li>
<li>$\frac{3}{5}$ Compromise calls for them to count slaves as $\frac{3}{5}$ of a person in census even though they had no rights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratification
<ul>
<li>9 out of 13 states required for ratification</li>
<li>Supporters and critics of the document (federalist and anti-federalists) sought to convince ratifying conventions of each state of their position
<ul>
<li>From this we get the Federalist Papers and Anti-Federalist Papers, which correspondingly make the case for why the Constitution should be ratified, and why it shouldn't</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Federalist vs Anti-Federalists</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anti-federalist position (primary source: <em>Brutus No. 1</em>) was that:
<ul>
<li>Governing power should be in the hands of the people instead of the government</li>
<li>Government should exist in small communities among citizens citizens of common beliefs (i.e. only in towns and states)</li>
<li>Believed a single government can't possibly govern a diverse group of people</li>
<li>The government will end up frustrated and impose its will on its people</li>
<li>Distance will affect people's sense of closeness to their representatives
<ul>
<li>The capitol was (at the time) in New York and that raised criticism due to its long distance from the Southern states</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Federalist position (primary source: <em>The Federalist Papers No. 10</em>)
<ul>
<li>This is Madison's direct response to <em>Brutus No. 1</em></li>
<li>A consolidated government will function better than a confederated one</li>
<li>Madison argues that <em>factionalism</em> will result in the destruction of the a decentralized Union while a large federalist republic will better balance the opinions of many people and be more stable
<ul>
<li>A faction is any group of people with things in common:
<ul>
<li>Eg. gender, race, religion, political views, social class, occupation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People breaking down into groups can act adversely to the common good of all
<ul>
<li>If the faction is in the majority they will oppress the minority</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, he accepts that factions will inevitably exist</li>
<li>Liberty fuels the development of faction - <em>&quot;Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two &quot;wrong ways&quot; to deal with factions
<ul>
<li>Remove liberty - but this would turn the US into an autocracy!</li>
<li>Make everyone think in the same way - but this would be impossible!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead, he says that the <em>right way</em> to deal with factions to manage the <em>effects</em> of factionalism
<ul>
<li>A republic is better than pure democracy because pure democracy will be turned into a <em>tyranny of the majority</em> by factionalism</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unlike Brutus, Madison proposes to <em>expand</em> the republic
<ul>
<li>A larger size leads to diversity</li>
<li>And diversity prevents the tyranny of factions
<ul>
<li>Because the more groups a representative represents, the more groups they can find common ground with</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Today would be Madison's nightmare!
<ul>
<li>There are only 2 real factions - Democrats and Republicans
<ul>
<li>It leaves no middle ground between the factions creating political polarization</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview of the Constitution</h2>
<h3>Bicameral Congress</h3>
<ul>
<li>The United States Congress is the <strong>lawmaking body</strong> of the United States</li>
<li>It's the first branch of government mentioned in the Constitution! (Article 1, Section 1)
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a <strong>Congress of the United States</strong>...&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Congress is one of the 3 branches of the national government (we call it the <em>legislative branch</em>)</li>
<li>It is also <em>bicameral</em> which means it has <strong>two</strong> houses* (chambers):
<ul>
<li>The Senate, which is the upper house;</li>
<li>The House of Representatives, which is the lower house;</li>
<li>*: We call these <em>houses</em> because legislatures are <em>housed</em> in debate rooms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>House Of Representatives</strong> is involved with...
<ul>
<li>Requirements to serve in the House of Representatives are:
<ul>
<li>You are a minimum of 25 years old</li>
<li>You have been a US citizen for at least 7 years</li>
<li>You are a legal resident of the state you represent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Representation is determined by population
<ul>
<li>Vermont, North/South Dakota, Wyoming, and Alaska have 1 representative</li>
<li>California (the most populous state) has 52</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The specific powers granted to the House of Representatives are:
<ul>
<li><em>Impeaching</em> the president and other federal officials (but crucially <strong>not</strong> holding the trial for an impeached official)
<ul>
<li>Impeachment is the process of giving an official a criminal indictment (basically saying that they did something bad enough to require a criminal trial)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Deciding presidential elections</em> if no candidate wins the majority of the electoral college (but this has almost never happened)</li>
<li>Starting any bill that aims to raise taxes (<em>&quot;The Power of the Purse&quot;</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Senate</strong> is involved with...
<ul>
<li>Requirements to serve in the Senate are:
<ul>
<li>You are a minimum of 30 years old</li>
<li>You have been a US citizen for at least 9 years</li>
<li>You are a legal resident of the state you represent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two senators are chosen from each state</li>
<li>The specific powers granted to the House of Representatives are:
<ul>
<li>Holding impeachment trials (but not starting the impeachment process)</li>
<li>Ratifying treaties (which requires a 2/3rd majority vote)</li>
<li>Confirming the appointment of executive officers (the <em>Confirmation Power</em>), such as:
<ul>
<li>Cabinet secretaries</li>
<li>Federal judges</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both senators and representatives are elected by the people (so anyone can become either!)</li>
<li>Why do we have 2 houses of the legislature with different powers?
<ul>
<li>Reason 1: The historical reason
<ul>
<li>When the Constitution was being drafted, large states and small states couldn't agree on how many legislators each state should be given</li>
<li>Large states would benefit if the number of legislators were chosen based on <strong>population</strong>, while small states would benefit if legislators were limited to the <strong>same number per state</strong></li>
<li>So the compromise was to have both!
<ul>
<li>Representatives would be chosen based on a state's population - we call this <strong>proportional representation</strong></li>
<li>Senators would need to be the same number per state - we call this <strong>equal representation</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reason 2: The practical reason
<ul>
<li>It was thought that one house of the legislature can limit the other</li>
<li>So it prevents the legislative branch (Congress) from having too much power in the three-branch system</li>
<li>Thus, dividing the legislature into two houses preserves the principle of the <strong>separation of powers</strong>
<ul>
<li>The upper house (senate) has longer terms and stricter requirements as senators were expected to act as custodians and were not tied to the changing whims of the people</li>
<li>The lower house (representatives) has shorter terms and less strict requirements as representatives were expected to be more responsive to their voters and more directly reflect the changing opinions of the people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Separation of Powers &amp; Checks and Balances</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>executive branch</strong> is the second branch of government mentioned in the Constitution (Article 2, Section 1)
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The executive power shall be vested in a <strong>president of the United States of America</strong>&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The executive branch includes both the President, acting administration, and a number of federal executive departments</li>
<li>The powers and obligations of the president are:
<ul>
<li>To preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States</li>
<li>To carry out the laws of the United States</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>judicial branch</strong> is the third branch of government mentioned in the Constitution (Article 3, Section 1)
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The executive power shall be vested in a <strong>president of the United States of America</strong>&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The judicial branch is also known as &quot;the Courts&quot; is responsible for interpreting the law
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in <strong>one supreme court</strong> and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time <strong>ordain and establish</strong>&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Framers of the Constitution deliberately implemented a series of checks on the powers of the different branches of government to keep them balanced
<ul>
<li>Each of the branches has the power to check (i.e. limit) the other two</li>
<li>The <strong>legislative branch</strong> was meant to prevent the president from becoming a tyrant and dictator like King George III, and to limit the <strong>executive branch</strong>
<ul>
<li>The power of impeachment allows Congress to remove the President from office</li>
<li>The powers of &quot;advice and consent&quot; allow Congress to reject the President's appointment of judges and officials</li>
<li>Congress also has the power to investigate executive activities and officers</li>
<li>If the President vetoes a law, Congress with a 2/3rd majority in both houses can override the veto</li>
<li>If the President wants to pass a law, Congress can refuse</li>
<li>Congress can refuse to appropriate funds for executive programs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>legislative branch</strong> also has the ability to limit the <strong>judicial branch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Congress has the power of impeaching judges</li>
<li>The Senate can reject judicial nominees before they become federal judges</li>
<li>Congress can add or take away courts to change the federal court system</li>
<li>Congress can also change the jurisdiction of federal courts</li>
<li>Congress can pass new laws that override the Supreme Court decisions (so long as the decisions aren't based on the Constitution)</li>
<li>Congress can propose Amendments to the Constitution which overrule federal court rulings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>executive branch</strong> has the ability to limit the <strong>legislative branch</strong>
<ul>
<li>The president can veto Congress's laws so that they don't go into effect (immediately)</li>
<li>The president can call Congress into a special session (but he/she can't make them pass new laws)</li>
<li>The president can carry out laws contrary to what Congress intended</li>
<li>The Vice President has the power to break ties in the Senate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>executive branch</strong> also has the ability to limit the <strong>judicial branch</strong>
<ul>
<li>The president has the power to nominate Supreme Court justices</li>
<li>The president also has the power to nominate federal court justices</li>
<li>The president can pardon people convicted by the courts, which cancels out their judgements</li>
<li>The president can also refuse to carry out court decisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last, the <strong>judicial branch</strong> has the ability to limit the <strong>legislative branch</strong>
<ul>
<li>The judiciary can declare laws passed by Congress unconstitutional</li>
<li>The Chief Justice presides over impeachment trials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>judicial branch</strong> also has the ability to limit the <strong>executive branch</strong>
<ul>
<li>The judiciary can declare executive actions unconstitutional</li>
<li>The judiciary issues warrants in federal crime cases and presides over Senate impeachments as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Essentially, the checks and balances system makes it more difficult for the government to act in ways that harm the acts and interests of the citizens, preventing a British-style centralized government that could lead to tyranny</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deep Dive into Federalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>The principle of <strong>federalism</strong> is the idea that power should be divided between the national government and individual states</li>
<li>It is derived from the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution, which states that <em>&quot;the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are <strong>reserved by it to the states respectively, or to the people</strong>&quot;</em></li>
<li>The idea is that the United States should be a federation of states under a <em>federal system</em>
<ul>
<li>The national government takes care of matters that affect all states, such as foreign relations, imports/exports, coinage, and building interstate/public infrastructure</li>
<li>States' governments take care of local matters such as property management, construction, business, and schools</li>
<li>There are two main &quot;styles&quot; of federalism throughout US history:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual federalism</strong> was the previous predominant form, and it set out strict rules for what the national government was in charge of, and what state governments were in charge of, making sure neither could interfere with the other
<ul>
<li>Under this system, state governments are much more powerful than the national government and had much broader jurisdiction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cooperative federalism</strong> is the current form, and it originated with the New Deal based on a controversial interpretation Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution - <em>&quot;To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>This interpretation allowed for the regulation of business nationwide and led to a much more powerful national government</li>
<li>Additionally, it changed federalism so that now the national government encourages states and localities to pursue <em>nationally-defined goals</em> and to adopt complimentary policies</li>
<li>The federal government uses funds to make states do what it wants and withdraws those funds if the states refuse to cooperate</li>
<li>Additionally, the federal government sets up <strong>regulations and rules</strong> that the states must follow</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Elections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Congressional elections are the most significant elections as they are the supposed to be the best way for the will of the people to mold the government
<ul>
<li>The House of Representatives holds elections as per Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution - <em>&quot;The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature&quot;</em></li>
<li>States typically have power to decide the electoral process for their representatives</li>
<li>The Senate holds elections where both senators are chosen by the entire state</li>
<li>Good candidates tend to have certain characteristics:
<ul>
<li>An unblemished record without past convictions or scandals</li>
<li>Idealistic ambitions and a strong sense of morality</li>
<li>The ability to finance a campaign (a source of money)
<ul>
<li>This is highly controversial as candidates can spend millions on campaigning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being an incumbent in office (having previously been elected and now seeking re-election)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Due to being inherently tied to needing to be re-elected, senators and representatives alike often choose to act in ways that are contrary to the public good or popular support</li>
<li>This allows them to build their personal brand and help them to get re-elected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presidential elections</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bill of Rights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Bill of Rights was originally passed to calm fears that the Constitution would create a strong national government that would trample individual civil liberties</li>
<li>It convinced the anti-federalists (those opposed to the Constitution and the precursors to the 19th-century Democrats) to eventually approve and pass the Constitution
<ul>
<li>It ensured that basic natural rights would be granted to citizens and could not be infringed by the national government</li>
<li>With it, it also enshrined the principle that compromise is a fundamental part of American government</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Federalism</h2>
<p><strong><img src="https://player.slideplayer.com/90/14411827/slides/slide_20.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federalism</strong> is a political system in which ultimate authority is shared between a central government and state or regional governments (devolution)</li>
<li>State power is defined by:
<ul>
<li>10th &amp; 14th Amendments
<ul>
<li><strong>Reserved powers</strong> are established by Amendment 10: <em>&quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supremacy Clause - federal laws trump state laws</li>
<li>Necessary and Proper Clause</li>
<li>Enumerated and Implied Powers
<ul>
<li>Enumerated powers are powers directly mentioned in the text of the Constitution</li>
<li>Implied Powers are the powers customarily given to the state and federal governments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Powers are divided as follows:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Case Study: Federalism's effect on Education</h3>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/12-10-15sfp-f1.png" width=300 />
</p>
<ul>
<li>One consequence of federalism is that it causes shared power between many different areas</li>
<li>Due to federalism, nearly half of K-12 education funding is provided by states:
<ul>
<li>Con: States have the power to control how children are educated</li>
<li>Pro/Con: Federalism creates incentives for schools to get better and thus raise taxes, improving the livelihoods of local communities</li>
<li>Pro: Private schools can coexist with public education</li>
<li>Con: As boards of education are elected, they can be influenced by local influencers thereby making the quality of education undependable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus, we often call federalism a <strong>laboratory for democracy</strong> - states are given free reign to experiment on different policies to find the best policy for the people</li>
<li><strong>Key Question:</strong> how do the 10th Amendment and Supremacy Clause reconcile with each other?
<ul>
<li>Answer: the <em>Supreme Court</em>! It decides who has authority in such disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2 main types of federalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dual federalism (marble cake) - separate and insulated powers and responsibilities within the jurisdictions of the federal and state governments</li>
<li>Cooperative federalism (layer cake) - shared powers and responsibilities between the states and the federal government</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em></h3>
<p>Precedent: In 1816, Maryland passed legislation to tax the Bank of the United States. James W. McCulloch, a cashier of the Baltimore branch of the Bank of the United States, refused to pay taxes to Maryland</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>dispute</strong> was over:
<ul>
<li>Did Congress have the authority to establish the Bank of the United States?</li>
<li>Did the Maryland law unconstitutionally interfere with congressional powers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>decision</strong> was <em>unanimous</em> and ruled that:
<ul>
<li>Congress had the power to establish the Bank of the United States because of the <em>Necessary and Proper Clause</em>
<ul>
<li>Congress possessed powers not explicitly outlined in the U.S. Constitution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maryland may not impose a tax on the bank because it is a <em>federal institution</em> (in accordance to the Supremacy Clause)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>implications</strong> are:
<ul>
<li>It sets the precedent that Congress possesses powers not explicitly outlined in the U.S. Constitution</li>
<li>States retained the power of taxation but could not use it to control federal commerce</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commerce Clause and Federalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Article I, Section 8: <em>Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce...</em></li>
<li>But <em>what</em> constitutes commerce?
<ul>
<li>Results in <em>Gibbons v. Ogden</em> in 1824
<ul>
<li>Ogden sues Gibbons over navigating the Hudson River</li>
<li>Ruling: Interstate navigation fell under the commerce regulation power and could only be regulated by Congress</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Heart of Atlanta Motel v. US</em> (1964)</li>
<li>Precedent: Civil Rights Act (bans segregation) was passed in 1964
<ul>
<li>Results:
<ul>
<li>Owner of hotel wanted to ban African Americans from staying at his hotel </li>
<li>Thus he cites his 5th Amendment rights to serve or not serve whomever he wanted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ruling:
<ul>
<li>The Commerce Clause required him to serve all ethnicities since 75% of his business comes from out of state</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>US v. Lopez</em>
<ul>
<li>The Gun Free Schools Act of 1990 prohibited the carrying of firearms within 100 feet of a public school</li>
<li>In 1992, Alfonso Lopez, a senior at Edison High School in San Antonio, Texas, carried a firearm into school with the intent of selling it and was arrested
<ul>
<li>Lopez argued that the Gun Free Schools Act was unconstitutional</li>
<li>Dispute:
<ul>
<li>Does the Commerce Clause enable Congress to prohibit the possession of firearms in schools?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ruling:
<ul>
<li>The Court reasoned that the Gun Free Schools Act was incompatible with Commerce Clause, and thus the Gun Free Schools Act was unconstitutional</li>
<li>The Court limited Congress's power to regulate under the Commerce Clause</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Federalism</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue sharing</strong> - money from federal taxes given to states with little/no restriction</li>
<li><strong>Grants-in-aid</strong> - nation government gives money to states during times of crisis (e.g. 9/11 public safety)</li>
<li><strong>Block grant</strong> - funding for broad purposes with fewer strings attached (e.g. a grant for education)</li>
<li><strong>Categorical grant</strong> - funding for <em>specific</em> purposes (e.g. a grant for revising school textbooks)</li>
<li><strong>Federal funding formula</strong> - formulas used by Congress to distribute money to states
<ul>
<li>States with low populations typically receive disproportionally more money</li>
<li>Otherwise, small state governments are often non-self-sustaining</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mandates vs. Waivers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandate</strong> - states must meet conditions/requirements, and if they do not become compliant then their funding is withdrawn
<ul>
<li>E.g. American Disability Act, No Child Left Behind Act, Clean Air Act</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conditions of aid</strong> - terms set by the federal government that states must meet in order to <em>receive</em> the funds
<ul>
<li>E.g. Federal highway funding is given as long as states set drinking age to 21</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Waiver</strong> - permission to not follow a mandate
<ul>
<li>E.g. certain states have been granted waivers for not being able to meet national standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Federal grants make up <em>nearly 1/3</em> of state budgets</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Presidency</h2>
<p>The purpose of the executive branch - more precisely, the original purpose of the executive branch - is to <em>execute</em> the law.</p>
<h3>Executive Powers</h3>
<p>Enumerated executive powers (explicitly named in the Constitution):</p>
<ul>
<li>Commander-in-chief of the armed forces</li>
<li>Power to receive</li>
<li>Power to grant pardons</li>
<li>Veto power/power to sign bills</li>
<li>Power to make treaties (subject to Senate approval)</li>
<li>Convene both Houses in &quot;extraordinary&quot; occasions</li>
<li>Power to appoint and commission judges, ministers, and public officers</li>
<li>Giving the state of the Union address (i.e. give recommendations to policy-makers)</li>
<li>Power to fill up Senate vacancies</li>
<li>Power to make sure laws are faithfully executed</li>
<li>Chief diplomat + appoints/receives ambassadors</li>
<li>Head of state and public figurehead</li>
</ul>
<p>Implied powers (not named in the Constitution):</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold press conferences</li>
<li>Serve as leader and representative to the people</li>
<li>Executive orders</li>
<li>Executive action</li>
<li>Executive privilege (keep information from the people in the name of national security)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key question: To what extent have the powers and functions of the presidency evolved over time?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Morris feared a powerful legislature (rule by the despotic rich and wealthy)</li>
<li>He believed that the executive branch should be a counter to the legislature</li>
<li>Is this still true today? Do we fear the legislative or executive branch more?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Evolution of the Presidency</h3>
<ul>
<li>Washington's example: the President of precedent (his assumption of the presidency set the precedent of presidential power)
<ul>
<li>The power of the executive power would only increase from his time forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Imperial Presidency: Expands the office beyond the Constitution
<ul>
<li>Could happen due to foreign, domestic, or economic crisis (Lincoln)</li>
<li>Popularity (Jackson)</li>
<li>Due to a megalomaniac (Nixon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stewardship Theory (Teddy Roosevelt): the President is only limited by what's in Constitution; the President's responsibility is to do <em>as much as possible</em> for the good of the people</li>
<li>FDR expanded presidency the most!</li>
<li>Limits on presidential power: 22nd, 20th, 25th Amendment + Impeachment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Veto Power</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gives the president significant legislative power
<ul>
<li>If a bill is vetoed, it is returned with the President's comments and suggestions</li>
<li>It creates dialogue between the branches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pocket veto - a type of veto by inaction</li>
<li>Line-item veto - a type of veto based on budgetary grounds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Federalist. No. 70</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hamilton describes the executive as an &quot;energetic&quot; figure - here &quot;energy&quot; means:
<ul>
<li>Rigorous, firm when needed to restrain Congress</li>
<li>Decisiveness and active role (e.g. desegregation)</li>
<li>Unitary - instead of a pluralist executive (rule by committee) the executive should be constrained to 1 person</li>
<li>Reflected in &quot;bully pulpit&quot; (speaking to the people to rally their support)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where are the limits on that &quot;energy&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<h3>SCOTUS v. POTUS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court can challenge the executive branch to expand or restrict executive power</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li><em>Korematsu v. US, 1944</em>
<ul>
<li>Context: During WWII, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 to intern Japanese-Americans</li>
<li><em>Korematsu</em>, a Japanese American, refused to comply with the executive order and was arrested</li>
<li>Ruling: Establishing the internment camps was legal and within the reach of executive authority</li>
<li>Result: Massively expanded executive power</li>
<li>Controversial because the decision was both unconstitutional <em>and</em> immoral</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer, 1952</em>
<ul>
<li>Context: During the Korean War, President Truman seized the majority of private steel mills to prevent a strike (which would have been detrimental to the war effort) </li>
<li>The Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company sued the federal government</li>
<li>Ruling: Private businesses could not be seized by the federal government</li>
<li>Result: Limited executive power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>US. v. Nixon, 1974</em>
<ul>
<li>Context: During the Watergate Scandal, President Nixon refused to hand overs tapes and security footage to the federal courts, citing &quot;national security&quot; concerns</li>
<li>Ruling: Executive privilege does not apply legal proceedings (and especially those that the president is involved in)</li>
<li>Result: Limited executive power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Trump v. Hawaii, 2018</em>
<ul>
<li>Context: In 2018, President Trump signed Executive Order 13780 which suspended entry for 90 days of foreign nationals from seven countries identified by Congress or the Executive as presenting heightened terrorism-related risks (primarily countries with large Muslim populations)</li>
<li>The state of Hawaii challenged the executive order under grounds it violated the 1st and 5th Amendments</li>
<li>Ruling: Trump's executive order does not exceed any statutory power of the president, and executive orders can be used to restrict immigration</li>
<li>Result: Expanded executive power (and upheld presidential authority)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where is the line to draw for executive power?
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court often can be affected by public opinion and political will</li>
<li>Additionally, the Supreme Court rules on constitutionality, which may not necessarily be equivocal with morality</li>
<li>Thus, limits of executive power are often drawn in peacetime with clear violations of the constitution, and expansions are drawn in wartime or difficult times</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Policy Agenda</h3>
<ul>
<li>A policy agenda is a set of issues, problems, or subjects, that is viewed as important by people involved in policy-marking</li>
<li>The president enacts his policy agenda with:
<ul>
<li>Votes/Pocket Vetoes</li>
<li>Authority as Commander-in-chief</li>
<li>Informal powers:
<ul>
<li>Executive agreements</li>
<li>Bargaining and persuasion</li>
<li>Executive Orders</li>
<li>Signing statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to persuade
<ul>
<li>State of the Union</li>
<li>Bully pulpit (&quot;bully&quot; here refers to its original meaning, which meant &quot;good&quot;)</li>
<li>Power as head of state and chief executive (hiring and firing people)</li>
<li>Meeting with important figures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impeachment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, impeachment is the process of indictment (charging a public official with a crime), not the actual conviction or removal itself</li>
<li>Impeachment ensures that elected public officials can be charged of crimes</li>
<li>Criteria listed in Article 2 Section 4 (very nebulous!)
<ul>
<li>Treason (act against one's country)</li>
<li>Bribery (giving money to influence public officials)</li>
<li>Other &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;
<ul>
<li>E.g. murder/perjury/trafficking etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Process
<ul>
<li>The Articles of Impeachment are brought out in the House of Representatives and a majority vote in favor will initiate an impeachment trial in the Senate (Article 1 Section 2 Clause 5)</li>
<li>The chief justice will preside over the trial held in the Senate, and a 2/3 majority of Senate will secure a conviction (Article 1 Section 3 Clause 6-7)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key question - is impeachment a political or legal proceeding?
<ul>
<li>Legal point of view
<ul>
<li>The Senate is required to take an oath to be nonpartisan during the trial</li>
<li>The trial in Senate takes place under legal terminology</li>
<li>There are high standards for impeachment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Political point of view
<ul>
<li>Impeachment is sometimes a shortcut to push political agendas because it is sometimes easier to impeach a sitting president than pass legislation with a majority (which is often non-existent for the minority party)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Historically, the majority of impeachment efforts failed:
<ul>
<li>The impeachment of Andrew Johnson was a result of Johnson’s removal of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton</li>
<li>The effort failed because it was determined that political conflicts and differing ideologies (the indirect reasons for the impeachment) were not a valid grounds for impeachment</li>
<li>The impeachment of Bill Clinton following the Lewinsky scandal also failed because the case against him was deemed not serious enough to warrant a removal from office</li>
<li>Trump’s two impeachment trials resulted in limited bipartisan support in the prior and latter</li>
<li>The only instance of a successful removal of a sitting president has been Nixon’s impeachment, where paradoxically Nixon was removed from office but not impeached (he resigned before impeachment would have been possible).</li>
<li>Political will had to be mustered for any successful impeachment, and sufficient political will for a removal of office has been exceedingly rare in American history</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evolution of Congress</h2>
<ul>
<li>Congress has the most enumerated powers of any branch of the federal government, including the powers to:
<ul>
<li>Lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises</li>
<li>Borrow money</li>
<li>Regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states</li>
<li>Establish rules for naturalization (i.e. becoming a citizen) and bankruptcy</li>
<li>To coin money, set its value, and punish counterfeiting</li>
<li>To fix the standard of weights and measures</li>
<li>To establish a post office and post roads</li>
<li>To issue patents and copyrights to inventors and authors</li>
<li>To create courts inferior to the Supreme Court</li>
<li>To define and punish piracies, felonies on the high seas, and crimes against the law of nations</li>
<li>To declare war</li>
<li>To raise and support an army and navy and to organize and govern them</li>
<li>To provide for a militia/federalize state militias</li>
<li>To exercise exclusive legislative powers over the seat of government and federal facilities</li>
<li>To &quot;make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into the execution all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do members of Congress vote?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Representational</strong> View
<ul>
<li>Members will vote based on their constituencies' wishes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Organizational View</strong>
<ul>
<li>Members vote along party lines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trustee View</strong>
<ul>
<li>Members vote based on their own conscience and beliefs regardless of party line or the views of their constituencies</li>
<li>This is based on the idea that representatives will be obliged to make the best decisions for the people based on their experience and judgement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Politico View</strong>
<ul>
<li>Doing whatever is politically expedient at the moment - a hybrid of multiple views of representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Party Lines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Party Vote</strong>: when 90% or more of one party votes together against 90% of the other party
<ul>
<li>The Whips will often see to it that party line is followed on certain issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pork barrel legislation</strong>: adding funding money to bills to incentivize a bill to be passed and &quot;bribing&quot; someone to vote in a certain way</li>
</ul>
<h3>Congressional Positions</h3>
<h4>President of the Senate</h4>
<ul>
<li>The President of the Senate is also the Vice President</li>
<li>Even though the President of the Senate is not a senator, they are the most high-ranking member of the Senate and preside over the Senate</li>
<li>They can vote on tie-breaking pieces of legislation but do not typically vote</li>
</ul>
<h4>President Pro Tempore</h4>
<ul>
<li>The President Pro Tempore (meaning &quot;president <em>for a time</em>&quot;) is the second-highest ranking member of the Senate</li>
<li>It is mostly a ceremonial position but the President Pro Tempore can preside over the Senate in the case of the Vice President's absence</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senate/House Majority Leader/Minority Leader</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Senate and House Majority Leader and Minority Leader are the senior leaders of the majority and minority parties</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senate/House Majority/Minority Whips</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Senate and House majority and minority whips are officers that ensure discipline and encourage members of their own party to fall in line</li>
</ul>
<h4>Speaker of the House</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Speaker of the House is the most powerful member of the House of Representatives and performs a variety of administrative tasks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Congressional Committees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Committees are used to manage similar tasks within Congress
<ul>
<li>It has the power to conduct hearings (unofficial power but very effective in changing public perceptions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Permanent committees</strong> are permanent panels with full legislative functions and oversight responsibilities</li>
<li><strong>Subcommittees</strong> are formed to tackle specific tasks within the jurisdiction of the full committees</li>
<li><strong>Select/Special Committees</strong> are groups appointed for a limited purpose and limited duration, often for investigations</li>
<li><strong>Joint Committees</strong> include members of both chambers to conduct studies, do research, or perform housekeeping tasks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Does Congress Truly Represent the People?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trust in the Congress is under 10% at the moment - what are its issues?</li>
<li><strong>Demographics</strong>: While growing more diverse, Congress still does not represent the whole spectrum of diversity of the American people</li>
<li><strong>The Incumbency Advantage</strong>: Senators/representatives seeking re-election (incumbents) almost always win re-election</li>
<li>Why do incumbents always win? 
<ul>
<li>The financial advantage - with more connections, incumbents are able to raise more money and thus have a more successful campaign</li>
<li>The precedent (&quot;face/name recognition&quot;) advantage - an incumbent with a successful term would already have a precedent to campaign on, while a challenger does not have any precedent and thus can appear less trustworthy to voters</li>
<li>The familiarity advantage - an incumbent is more experienced with the political system and is thus more adept at perfecting their personal image and &quot;brand&quot; to get more votes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does incumbency impact how we are represented?
<ul>
<li>Positive: We get to know our senator/representative well</li>
<li>Positive: Our senator/representative gets to &quot;know the system&quot; well because of experience and is thus more likely to be able to get a piece of legislation through</li>
<li>Negative: Incumbency creates &quot;professional politicians&quot; can become disconnected from the people</li>
<li>Negative: No new voices, senators/representatives don't keep up to date with the changing tastes of the people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Political Polarization</strong>: Polarization is incredibly high and the political climate is highly divisive, with few chances at compromise
<ul>
<li>People on both sides believe that the election of the opposite party's candidate will permanently harm the country</li>
<li>There has been a large decrease in moderate and independent voters</li>
<li>Large percentages of both political parties think that the other party is a threat to the nation's well being</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statistics on social media and engagement show that people are more inclined to like polarizing comments rather than bipartisan/neutral comments</li>
<li>Polarization has a very large impact on the Congress' ability to fulfill their responsibilities
<ul>
<li>Divided governments lead to difficult decision-making as outside factors such as an opposing party and the citizens' opinions could result in negative feedback and backlash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Does A Bill Become a Law?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bill can be <strong>introduced</strong> by any representative in the House of Representatives or the Senate</li>
<li>A bill is then referred to a committee by the Speaker of the House or Presiding Officer of the Senate based on Senate/House rules</li>
<li>The bill is now studied by the committee
<ul>
<li>Within a committee, a bill may be referred to a subcommittee - a specialized research branch of a committee - or kept in the main (&quot;standing&quot;) committee
<ul>
<li>Hearings are held
<ul>
<li>Experts come in to discuss the bill</li>
<li>Witnesses are received</li>
<li>Public support is built</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the hearing the bill is &quot;marked up&quot; - the standing committee/subcommittees considers the bill, possibly amending it, and then either accepts or rejects it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Standing committee for vote
<ul>
<li>If the majority votes to report a bill out of committee then it gets out of committee with a <strong>report</strong> - a document detailing the decision of committee and how the committee arrived at that decision</li>
<li>Committee can also choose to hold a bill hostage
<ul>
<li>A discharge petition can be used to bring the bill out of committee by by &quot;discharging&quot; the committee from further consideration of a bill or resolution</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next, the bill is debated on the Senate and the House floor</li>
<li>The House and Senate votes on the bill - once passed, it goes to the White House
<ul>
<li>The President signs or vetoes the bill</li>
<li>Congress can override a presidential veto with a ⅔ majority</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in Representation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reapportionment</strong> is the process of shifting seats (of the 435 in the House) based on shifting population</li>
<li><strong>Redistricting</strong> is the process of redrawing district lines within a state to better reflect representation within that state</li>
<li><strong>Gerrymandering</strong> is when district boundaries are manipulated by drawing them in bizarre shapes to favor one party
<ul>
<li>The Secretaries of State are elected officials and often draw lines to favor their own parties</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Congressional District Conundrum</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are many states (e.g. Alaska, Delaware, Wyoming) that only have 1 congressional district (at-large: everyone in the state is voting for one House position)</li>
<li>California, by contrast, has <strong>53 members</strong> of the House of Representatives</li>
<li>These numbers cause a citizen in Wyoming to have the representation equivalent to 50x of the representation of a New Yorker</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gerrymandering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gerrymandering causes representatives to feel &quot;safe&quot; about adopting a far more right- or left-leaning ideologies and reduces the number of moderates</li>
<li>It disproportionally affects how citizens are represented and can secure elected positions to a given politician contrary to the wishes of their electorates</li>
<li>Solutions to gerrymandering?
<ul>
<li>Having an independent panel to deal with redistricting (an electoral commission)</li>
<li>Using fixed mathematical algorithms to draw district borders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The District System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Today, the House of Representatives (not the Senate) uses a single member district system where every state is divided into <strong>electoral districts</strong></li>
<li>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>Each person in the state is (theoretically) equally represented with 1 person, 1 vote</li>
<li>Increases voter turnout because representatives have closer political views to their constituents</li>
<li>Representatives are more closely tied to their local constituents</li>
<li>More than 1 party can be represented</li>
<li>Easier to run and maintain than an &quot;at-large system&quot; (where the entire state is one district)</li>
<li>Prevent a narrow majority from taking power and dominating (tyranny of the majority)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Causes a 2-party system to form because of the &quot;single member&quot; nature of the system - winner takes all, minority parties are unable to compete with established parties</li>
<li>Creates a need of redistricting from time to time, which opens the door for gerrymandering</li>
<li>Elected officials draw the lines during redistricting</li>
<li>Emphasis is put on local interests rather than the common good - encourages &quot;provincialism&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternatives:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranked-choice voting</strong> (also known as preferential voting) is when voters place their representative choices in order of preference, and elimination rounds decide the outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid voting</strong> (a complex system whose complexity made it short-lived)</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative voting</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Voting Rights Act (1965)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Often called the most powerful and consequential piece of legislation in history</li>
<li>State no longer had discretion to determine voter qualifications for its residents
<ul>
<li>Federal oversight now exists over state voting procedures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Pre-clearance&quot; provisions (any changes to state election laws must be approved by the federal government)
<ul>
<li>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>States were unreliable in guaranteeing fair election laws even when they were given the opportunity to make necessary changes without federal oversight</li>
<li>Rapid increase (40%) in the black voter representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Takes state powers away</li>
<li>Treats states differently</li>
<li>No time frame (though pre-clearance provisions were removed by <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shaw v. Reno (1993)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ruth Shaw was an elderly widow who had previously sued the North Carolina House of Representatives for partisan gerrymandering</li>
<li>During North Carolina's redistricting in 1991, 2 black majority districts were created in response to the Voting Rights Act's requirement for sufficient minority representation</li>
<li>The Department of Justice, headed by Attorney General Janet Reno, drew a district plan that formed 2 districts </li>
<li>Shaw argued that:
<ul>
<li>Gerrymandering, even when used to uphold minority power (or any other good cause), is problematic</li>
<li>The Constitution <em><strong>is</strong></em> colorblind (or at least is supposed to be)</li>
<li>People should not vote along racial lines
<ul>
<li>Race is a social construct that lumps people regardless of individual beliefs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whereas the Department of Justice defended that:
<ul>
<li>Minority representation is important, especially in mitigating the risk of a tyranny of the majority</li>
<li>Colorblindness dilutes minority districts</li>
<li>Voting can be racial and represent identity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a narrow 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the redistricting was a valid violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, arguing that the &quot;perverse shape&quot; made it impossible to see the redistricting plans as anything but a racial gerrymander, and that it constituted an effort to separate voters into different districts based on race
<ul>
<li>The court argued that while district lines must be <em>conscious</em> of race, district must not be solely based on race either</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bureaucracy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The federal government's executive branch, apart from the President, is composed of ~430 agencies</li>
<li>4 million people are employed by the government</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Bureaucracy?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>bureaucracy</strong>  is a large, complex organization composed of appointed officials
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracies enhance efficiency (theoretically)</li>
<li>They are instruments of policy implementation</li>
<li>Legislatures find it valuable</li>
<li>They implement and enforce laws <strong>but also</strong> to create policy that has the <em>force of law</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>George Washington started the bureaucracy because he recognized that other people were more skilled at specialized tasks
<ul>
<li>For a time, <strong>patronage</strong> was the method to appoint officials (hiring based on political favors)</li>
<li>The <strong>Pendleton Civil Service Act</strong> (1881) made major changes that:
<ul>
<li>Hiring based on merit</li>
<li>Entrance exam to find and hire qualified candidates (Civil Service Exams)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Hatch Act (1940)</strong> prohibited federal employees from endorsing a political campaign</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Types of Bureaucratic Agencies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cabinet Department</strong> The 15 cabinet departments are major administrative units that have responsibility for conducting broad areas of government operation</li>
<li><strong>Independent Executive Agencies</strong> have a narrower score than a department, but perform a <em>service</em> function (e.g. NASA, CIA, Federal Reserve, FTC, USPS)</li>
<li><strong>Independent Regulatory Commissions</strong> exist to regulate a specific economic activity or interest (watchdog over corporations businesses, and government) such as the FDA, SDA, EPA, FCC</li>
<li><strong>Government Corporations</strong> are government-owned businesses created by Congress that serve a public need (e.g. Amtrak, PBS, MTA)</li>
<li>Structure of the bureaucracy:
<ul>
<li>Large</li>
<li>Specialized units/expertise</li>
<li>Tenure protections/hard to fire</li>
<li>Based on merit</li>
<li>Independent regulatory commissions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Criticisms of the Bureaucracy</h4>
<ul>
<li>“Red tape” – maze of government rules, regulations, and paperwork that makes gov overwhelming to citizens</li>
<li>Conflict – agencies that often work toward opposite goals </li>
<li>Duplication – agencies appear to do the same thing </li>
<li>Unchecked growth – agencies expand unnecessarily at high costs</li>
<li>Waste and redundancy – spending more than necessary </li>
<li>Lack of accountability &amp; mismanagement – difficult to fire an incompetent bureaucrat</li>
<li>Issue networks - various interest groups unite to promote a common vested agenda (like factions of Fed. 10)
<ul>
<li>Issue networks and bureaucracies form <strong>iron triangles</strong>, a close relationship between interest groups, Congress, and bureaucracy</li>
<li>They can cause regulation to be loosened for issue networks - creating policy that benefits interests groups that support them, and do not have the general welfare of the public in mind
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Irontriangle.PNG" alt="Iron Triangle" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revolving door - members of interest groups can become members of the bureaucracy and vice-versa</li>
</ul>
<h4>Checks and Balances of the Bureaucracy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Congress can regulate <strong>bureaucracy</strong> by cutting off funding and holding hearings of leaders of bureaucracies but can't really regulate interest groups because they are not part of the government</li>
<li>The president can appoint heads of 15 cabinet departments and several independent executive agencies</li>
<li>The Judiciary can make court rulings that limit bureaucratic practices and declare bureaucratic actions unconstitutional</li>
</ul>
<h2>Civil Rights and Civil Liberties</h2>
<h3>Civil Rights v. Civil Liberties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Civil Liberties
<ul>
<li>Protects us <em>from</em> the government (Bill of Rights)</li>
<li>Protecting the individual from government abuse</li>
<li>&quot;Congress shall make no law abridging...&quot; - spells us what the government <strong>cannot</strong> do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Civil Rights
<ul>
<li>Protections <em>given</em> to you by the government</li>
<li>Protecting the minority from majority abuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations of Civil Liberties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Certain situations do not allow you to exercise your civil liberties, such as:
<ul>
<li>Yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater - &quot;clear and present danger&quot; with your speech</li>
<li>Publishing classified government governments if you gain access to them by legal means</li>
<li>Refusing a search of your bag/locker at school</li>
<li>Wearing whatever you want (offensive clothing/revealing clothing)</li>
<li>Refusing a TSA search at the airport (you can refuse...but then you can't fly!)</li>
<li>Refusing to comply with a DUI stop (driving under the influence)</li>
<li>Bringing a ceremonial knife to school as part of a religious practice</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bill of Rights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Bill of Rights are the collective name of the first 10 Amendments of the US Constitution</li>
<li>Created as a compromise to satisfy Anti-Federalists in 1791</li>
<li>It is a list that prevents the government from infringing from on several key individual rights</li>
<li>The Bill of Rights includes:
<ul>
<li>Freedom of expression</li>
<li>Right to bear arm</li>
<li>Quartering of soldiers</li>
<li>Search, arrest, and seizure</li>
<li>Rights of the accused</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Quartering Act</em> created fears of housing soldiers in the homes of civilians</li>
<li>Freedom of assembly and speech were suppressed by the British</li>
<li>Thus the basic necessity of a Bill of Rights became apparent</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 1st Amendment</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/periodicpresidents.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PTOTA-1st-Amendment-new-1024x683.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establishment Clause</strong>: Intended to prevent government from involving itself in religion</li>
<li><strong>Free Exercise Clause:</strong> intended to prevent government from interfering with individuals practicing their religion</li>
</ul>
<h4>Establishment Clause: Lemon Test</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>lemon test</strong> rules that <em>all</em> government actions violate the Establishment Clause <strong>unless</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It has a significant secular (i.e. non-religious) purpose</li>
<li>It does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>It does not foster excessive entanglement between government</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Establishment Clause: Engel v. Vitale (1962)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Context: The New York State Board of Regents authorized a short, voluntary prayer for recitation at the start of each school day</li>
<li>A group of organizations joined forces in challenging the prayer</li>
<li>The Court ruled in favor</li>
</ul>
<h4>Free Exercise Clause: Wisconsin v. Yoder</h4>
<ul>
<li>Context: Amish parents traditionally homeschool their children in accordance with the Amish religion</li>
<li>Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller, both members of the Old Order Amish religion, were prosecuted under a Wisconsin law that required all children to attend public schools until age 16</li>
<li>The parents refused to send their children to such schools after the eighth grade, arguing that high school attendance was contrary to their religious beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Free Speech and Press Clause: Schenck v. US (1919)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently, free speech restrictions are based on time, place, and manner of speech</li>
<li>During World War I, socialists Charles Schenck and Elizabeth Baer distributed leaflets urging the public to dodge the draft</li>
<li>They were prosecuted under the Espionage Act of 1917 which prohibited criticism of the draft</li>
<li>The Court ruled that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment does not shield advocacy “urging conduct deemed unlawful” under the Espionage Act
<ul>
<li>Justice Holmes famously compared the leaflets to falsely shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theatre, which is <em>not</em> protected speech</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sets precedence that there is a <em>limit</em> to free speech</li>
<li>Speech is restricted when it <em>“approaches creating a clear and present danger of a significant evil&quot;</em></li>
<li>Raises questions of <em>Civil Liberties vs. Security</em>
<ul>
<li>Most of the time, speech is perfectly harmless, but there are exceptions</li>
<li>We'd rather have civil liberties with occasional troublesome speech than no civil liberties at all</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Free Speech and Press Clause: Tinker v. Des Moines (1969)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In December 1965, a group of students in Des Moines held a meeting in the home of 16-year-old Christopher Eckhardt to plan a public showing of their support for a truce in the Vietnam war</li>
<li>They decided to wear black armbands as a form of symbolic protest against the Vietnam War</li>
<li>Supreme Court rules that the armbands did not constitute &quot;a <em>substantial</em> disruption&quot; and so were protected under free speech</li>
<li>Additionally, because the armbands were a form of <em>political speech</em>, which is especially protected under the Constitution, the students' 1st Amendment rights could not be infringed upon school grounds</li>
<li>It sets the precedent that speech must be proven to be “substantially or materially” disrupting, before disciplinary action can be taken</li>
</ul>
<h4>Free Speech and Press Clause: US v. New York Times (1971)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The New York Times wanted to publish the <em>Pentagon Papers</em>, a massive set of classified government documents revealing government incompetence in the Vietnam War</li>
<li>The Nixon administration however tried to suppress the Times, citing a need to exercise <strong>prior restraint</strong> (censorship for the sake of security)</li>
<li>The Court ruled that the New York Times had the right to publish the papers under the freedom of speech protections under the First Amendment</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Types of Speech protected under the 1st Amendment</h4>
<p>The following types of speech are protected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political speech</li>
<li>Hate speech</li>
<li>Satire (e.g. SNL)</li>
<li>Veiled threats</li>
<li>A teacher discussing his/her political views in the classroom (unless the teacher chooses to indoctrinate)</li>
<li>False claims on a news network intended to misinform
The following types of speech are <strong>not</strong> protected:</li>
<li>Incitement of violence</li>
<li>Libel/slander (due to damages or defamations of character and reputation)</li>
<li>Direct threats</li>
<li>Speech that silences someone else (e.g. blackmail, intimidation)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 2nd Amendment</h3>
<h4>DC v. Heller (2008)</h4>
<ul>
<li>DC law prohibited citizens from possessing unregistered firearms, and required that firearms be handled in certain ways (e.g. trigger lock on).</li>
<li>Additionally, bearing firearms at home was limited to a 1-year license subject to the approval of the Chief of Police</li>
<li>Heller was a policeman residing in DC who applied to keep a firearm at home, but was denied, and the </li>
<li>The Court ruled that the DC law was unconstitutional and violated the 2nd Amendment rights of citizens</li>
<li>Establishes that the 2nd Amendment intended for an <strong>individual right</strong> to bear arms - that is, anyone has the rights to use a firearm.</li>
</ul>
<h4>McDonald v. Chicago (2010)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Similar to DC v. Heller except with a state instead of a federal territory</li>
<li>Chicago argued that the precedent set by <em>DC v. Heller</em> did not apply because the 2nd Amendment only applied to federal areas and did not apply to the states</li>
<li>Court used the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause</li>
<li>Sets precedent that the Second Amendment also applied to the states (incorporation via the Due Process clause)</li>
<li>Controversial Question: What is the limit to bearing arms?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Restrictions on bearing arms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can you carry a weapon into a public space or spaces of large congregations? Or should you have professional armed security in certain areas?</li>
<li>Specialized licenses for certain areas? Training requirements? Possession of license for a long enough time? How do you license people?</li>
<li>One limitation for the entire country? Or different requirements per state?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 4th - 8th Amendment (Rights of the Accused)</h3>
<h4>Due Process: A Guaranteed Right</h4>
<ul>
<li>Procedural Due Process: the manner in which a law is carried out</li>
<li>Substantive Due Process: the essence of a law (life, liberty, property, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>4th Amendment: Searches and Seizures</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exclusionary Rule</strong>: evidence obtained without due process is inadmissible in court -&gt; prevents an overly aggressive police force
<ul>
<li>Juries will be told to &quot;forget&quot; the evidence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Probable Cause:</strong> allows police to conduct a search without a warrant
<ul>
<li><em>Mapp v. Ohio</em> incorporates this part of the 4th Amendment and establishes the need for probable cause to a search without a warrant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Civil Liberties During Wartime</h4>
<ul>
<li>Alien and Sedition Acts of 1789</li>
<li>Sedition Act of 1917</li>
<li>Espionage and Sedition Acts of 1918</li>
<li>1950s McCarthyism</li>
<li>Patriot Act of 2001</li>
<li>Freedom Act of 2015 (replaced Patriot Act)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Case Study: Patriot Act</h4>
<ul>
<li>Passed via popular support in the wake of 9/11</li>
<li>The Patriot Act aimed to counter terrorism:
<ul>
<li>Expands surveillance, e.g. tracking business records</li>
<li>New technology updates for fighting crimes</li>
<li>Wiretapping authorization</li>
<li>Prohibits harboring terrorists</li>
<li>Law enforcement officials can obtain a search warrant anywhere where a terrorist act occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But restricted a lot of individual liberties</li>
<li>More info available <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/what_is_the_patriot_act.pdf">here</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>5th Amendment: Freedom from Self-Incrimination</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prohibits detaining a prisoner hostage to order to make them confess</li>
<li>Gives prisoners the ability to remain silent</li>
</ul>
<h4>6th Amendment: Right to Counsel, Speedy Trial</h4>
<ul>
<li>The right to an attorney and the &quot;Miranda warning&quot; came as a result of <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em> and <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em></li>
<li>In <em>Betts v. Brady</em>, the Court ruled that if a defendant did not have a lawyer, then the state did not have to provide them an attorney except under special cases
<ul>
<li>This would've potentially violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it makes it disproportionately more likely that poorer defendants would be convicted, and further, defendants would get different treatment based on their financial condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em> the precedent was overturned, and the Court held that it was consistent with the Constitution to require state courts to appoint attorneys for defendants who could not afford to retain counsel on their own.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7th Amendment: Right to Trial in Civil Case</h4>
<h4>8th Amendment: Cruel and Unusual Punishment</h4>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Furman v. Georgia</em> the Supreme Court set the standard that a punishment would be “cruel and unusual” if it was too severe for the crime, if it was arbitrary, if it offended society’s sense of justice, or it if was not more effective than a less severe penalty</li>
<li>Controversy: Does the death penalty violate the 8th Amendment?
<ul>
<li>An originalist reading would say that the Constitution neither condones nor sanctions the death penalty, and it's the choice of the states for whether to use the death penalty or not</li>
<li>But a contextualist reading would say that contemporary standards of decency would regard taking of life as overly cruel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Goals of the Penal System</h4>
<ul>
<li>Punishment</li>
<li>Deterrent</li>
<li>Separation/Protection</li>
<li>Rehabilitation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Right to Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although the Constitution does not explicitly mention privacy, it often implies a right to privacy</li>
<li>References to some form of privacy are found in the 4th, 9th, and 14th Amendments</li>
</ul>
<h4>Abortion and Reproductive Rights</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Roe v. Wade</em> created trimester standard</li>
<li><em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em></li>
<li>&quot;Undue Burden&quot; Standard: Laws that regulate or prohibit abortion are unconstitutional if it is shown that the regulation adds substantial obstacles to the path of a woman seeking abortion, and does not produce sufficient health benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Civil RIghts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Civil Rights are protections by the government from prosecution, discimmination, and </li>
</ul>
<h4>Brown v. Board of Education</h4>
<ul>
<li>Landmark case in civil rights</li>
<li>Brought by NAACP's legal defense fund
<ul>
<li>The NAACP utilized a &quot;legal strategy&quot; as opposed to protests, civil disobedience, and boycotts</li>
<li>This made it more palatable to the Ameican public than other strategies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overturns <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> because of the idea that &quot;separate is inherently unequal&quot;
<ul>
<li>Thus, segregation violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Desegregates schools</li>
<li>But it sets a <strong>powerful precedent</strong> of prohibiting legalised discrimmination - and ends Jim Crow</li>
<li>Makes it possible to have permanent legal and legislative change</li>
</ul>
<h4>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</h4>
<ul>
<li>King was in Birmingham because it was one of the most segregated cities at the time</li>
<li>Context
<ul>
<li>&quot;Project C&quot; sit in campaign</li>
<li>&quot;Birmingham Marches&quot; - trains high school and college students in non-violent protest
<ul>
<li>Specifically, they trained students in how they could handle violent arrests</li>
<li>Getting arrested was the point</li>
<li>Students and organizers were met by Eugene &quot;Bill&quot; Connor's aggressive police force</li>
<li>The intent was to shock the American public in seeing innocent children being brutally attacked by the police on mass media outlets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>King's letter is a model for the role of the individual in society</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 14th Amendment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Section 1 provides for naturalization and citizenship for all persons born in the US or born to parents with US citizenship (birthright citizenship), and prevents any state from making or enforcing any law <em>&quot;depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; [or] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws&quot;</em></li>
<li>Section 2 guarantees the right to vote for all (male) citizens over the age of 21 and requires apportionment of representatives based on the total population of a state (overriding the 3/5 compromise)</li>
<li>Section 3 prevents anyone who had aided or engaged in an insurrection from serving in public office
<ul>
<li>But Congress can remove this limitation by a ⅔ vote in each house</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 4 clarifies that the US will not pay off war debts and slave debts for the seceded Southern states</li>
<li>Section 5 vests Congress with the authority to adopt “appropriate” legislation to enforce the Amendment</li>
</ul>
<h4>14th Amendment Clauses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Citizenship Clause
<ul>
<li>Provides race-blind citizenship based on birth/naturalization</li>
<li>All citizens of each state should have the same basic civil rights (though not necessarily the same <em>political</em> rights)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Due Process Clause
<ul>
<li>Prohibits the states from depriving “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law”</li>
<li>Expands the provisions of the 5th Amendment to the states as well as the federal government</li>
<li>Today, <em>&quot;due process&quot;</em> constitutes:
<ul>
<li>Notifying the accused of the charges brought against them</li>
<li>Giving the accused an opportunity to be heard</li>
<li>Providing the accused a trial with an impartial tribunal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also provides protections for rights not enumerated in the Constitution (e.g. freedom of contract, right to privacy, right to contraception, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Equal Protection Clause
<ul>
<li>Prohibits both states and the federal government from discrimination on the basis of race
<ul>
<li>It has however expanded to more than just racial discrimination, and now includes protections against discrimination based on e.g. sexual orientation, immigration status, wedlock status at birth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Privilege and Immunities Clause
<ul>
<li>Establishes the citizens have &quot;privileges and immunities&quot;</li>
<li>Protects fundamental rights of individual citizens and restrains state efforts to discriminate against out-of-state citizens</li>
<li>However, the Privileges and Immunities Clause extends not to all rights, but only to <em>fundamental</em> rights</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Affirmative Action</h3>
<ul>
<li>Affirmative Action describes a varied set of policies where race is taken into account</li>
<li>Arguments for it say that:</li>
<li>Arguments against it say that:
<ul>
<li>It pretends to solve a problem that no longer exists (since explicit racism is now rare)</li>
<li>It's been implemented in some form for 25+ years and it hasn't succeeded in its goals</li>
<li>It makes race more important than qualifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under the Constitution, race-based discrimmination is illegal</li>
<li>In <em>Fisher v. University of Texas</em>, SCOTUS ruled that diversity in the student body was a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in the admissions process, and as such, affirmative action policies could be permissible under <strong>strict scrutiny</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Terms and Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Amicus Briefs</em> (&quot;friends of the Court&quot;) are written expositions of the views of a certain interest group, sent to the Supreme Court, and explaining why the Court should rule in a certain way</li>
<li><em>Certiorari</em> is a writ (request) to have the actions of a lower court reviewed by a higher court</li>
<li><em>Strict Scrutiny</em> is a judgement that a policy is &quot;precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest&quot;, and that no alternative policy would provide the same benefits</li>
</ul>
<h2>FRQ Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 types of FRQ (~10 min each except for argumentative essay)
<ul>
<li>Concept application - you will read about a real or hypothetical scenario</li>
<li>SCOTUS Comparison - compare an unknown Supreme Court case with one you have studied</li>
<li>Quantitative/Qualitative Analyses - interpreting a graph, data set, political cartoon, speech, etc.</li>
<li>Argumentative Essay - must have:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>defensible</strong> thesis that establishes a line of reasoning! Underline or bold it as a best practice! The &quot;because&quot; and &quot;due to&quot; shows reasoning
<ul>
<li>E.g. <em>&quot;The trustee model of legislative representation is the best reflection of the founders’ intentions in setting up American democracy <strong>because</strong> it offers the best hope for what the Preamble to the Constitution calls “a more perfect union,” one that will bring together war-rung factions and increase harmony.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use two pieces of specific and relevant evidence to support your claim</li>
<li>Explain with reasoning how or why the evidence supports the claim</li>
<li>Respond to an opposing or alternate perspective</li>
<li>Go back and restate that while the counter exists, your argument is still correct</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: the Argumentative Essay is <em>not</em> a &quot;true&quot; essay! Do not worry about transitions and fluidity or rhetorical prowess, just answer the question!</li>
</ul>
</li>
