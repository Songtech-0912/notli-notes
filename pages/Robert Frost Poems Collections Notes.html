        <h1>Robert Frost Poems Collection Notes</h1>
<h2>Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening</h2>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker is a stranger who stops in the woods behind a lone house - <em>&quot;Whose woods these are I think I know&quot;</em></li>
<li>The occasion is <em>&quot;the darkest evening of the year&quot;</em></li>
<li>The person is enjoying the silence and loneliness - <em>the woods are lovely, dark and deep</em></li>
<li>But he is still dedicated to his goal - <em>&quot;And miles to go before I sleep&quot;</em></li>
<li>Rhyme scheme
<ul>
<li>The first two lines rhyme</li>
<li>The third line of each stanza establishes the rhyme for the next stanza</li>
<li>Mirrors how one thought leads to another</li>
<li>Rhyme scheme is broken on last two lines
<ul>
<li>Emphasizes repetition because all four lines now rhyme</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;He gives his harness bells a shake / To ask if there is some mistake&quot;</em> - the perspective of the horse is confused as to why they are stopping, not understanding the value of being alone</li>
<li>The natural surroundings inspire the ideas of the poem
<ul>
<li>The owner of the woods doesn't live in the woods itself, he lives in the village</li>
<li>That's why there is no house</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Power of nature to soothe and calm ourselves</li>
<li>The last stanza stresses that obligations and responsibilities cannot be escaped from</li>
<li>The monolithic end sound of each but the ending stanzas establishes an ideal place that the speaker wishes to be in and gives him time to linger on in the woods</li>
<li>THe final stanza shows the speaker's reluctance to leave the woods but also the pressing need to do so, because he has &quot;no more&quot; stanzas to linger on with</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The setting is in autumn - <em>&quot;in a yellow wood&quot;</em></li>
<li>Both roads were the same - <em>&quot;just as fair&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>The perceived differences are only a product of the author's imagination</li>
<li>However, once the author's imagination starts to characterize the roads (erroneously) as different, <strong>then</strong> they are no longer the same</li>
<li>And <em>&quot;that has made all the difference&quot;</em> - in fact, Frost is not saying you should travel the &quot;less travelled road&quot;</li>
<li>Edward Thomas connection - he decided to interpret the poem seriously and personally</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rhyme scheme</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deceptively simple poem but very complex and nuanced in interpretation</li>
<li>Is the &quot;sigh&quot; looking back a positive or negative one?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Most Of it</h2>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker is not the same as the subject</li>
<li>The subject is a solitary wanderer on the shores of a lake, crying out to the other side for someone to talk to him
<ul>
<li>A cliff is behind the lake</li>
<li>We start with the subject completely alone and without a sound from around him</li>
<li>However he doesn't get an answer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yet, instead of a human voice answering him, it is nature which respons - with a powerful wave that ripples across the lake</li>
<li>The wave hits shore, <em>&quot;pouring like a waterfall&quot;</em> and stumbling into the rocks</li>
<li><em>&quot;Is not its own love back in copy speech / But counter-love, original response.&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>He only gets an echo back from his cry - because his request to &quot;speak&quot; to nature is not the proper way to interact with nature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>The poem is built of 5 quatrains (collections of 4 rhyming lines)</li>
<li>There are 2 main sections:
<ul>
<li>The first section is from lines 1-9, and the second section is from lines 10-20</li>
<li>The first section is how the main character is handling himself - trying to have a conversation with nature</li>
<li>The second section is from lines 10-20, nature shows up, but the main character leaves dissatisfied</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship between man and nature
<ul>
<li>The person tries to build a connection with nature <strong>in the wrong way</strong></li>
<li>Nature is ultimately depicted as powerful and impossible to control and bend to human will, and it must be accepted as it is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abrupt ending <em>&quot; — and that was all&quot;</em></li>
<li>The speaker of the poem is critical of the main character (subject)
<ul>
<li>When nature presents itself, the subject isn't even satisfied with the special occasion</li>
<li>So he's interacting with nature on his terms rather than nature's terms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acquainted With The Night</h2>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker is speaking first person and has comfort in the night</li>
<li>He avoids people of the city <em>(&quot;passed by the watchman on his beat&quot;)</em></li>
<li>Nature is the measure by which he tells the time <em>(&quot;One luminary clock...Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right&quot;)</em></li>
<li>Voluntary self-isolation</li>
<li>Nearly every sentence starts with <em>&quot;I have&quot;</em></li>
<li>First and last lines start the same way</li>
<li>&quot;The Cry&quot; isn't a communication to him</li>
<li>The poem is discussing events that happen in retrospect</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Comparisons with <em>We grow accustomed the dark</em>
<ul>
<li>Frost has a conscientious and controlled tone</li>
<li>Dickinson has a self-encouraging and conquering tone</li>
<li>&quot;Acquaintance&quot; is a choice, &quot;accustomed&quot;</li>
<li>Both speakers are walking, but:
<ul>
<li>Frost's speaker is choosing to go out, Dickinson's speaker is forced into situation</li>
<li>One is in a personal setting (a home), the other is in a more impersonal and urban setting</li>
<li>Frost's character is done, Emily's character is still going through the dark</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Complete Response</h4>
<p>At first glance, both poems are similar in subject matter and in terms of setting. Both speakers speak in first person and describe their experiences of loneliness in the dark. However, differences begin to emerge with respect to the types and results of loneliness. Dickinson's &quot;Accustomed To The Dark&quot; emphasizes loneliness as a detrimental state of being,  the discomfort and uncertainty of the dark, and only with great effort do &quot;the bravest...learn to see&quot;. Though portraying darkness and lonliness in a negative light, Dickinson can therefore contrast it with the strength and courage of &quot;the brave&quot; who overcome the darkness and become &quot;accustomed to the dark&quot;. Whereas, Frost's &quot;Acquainted to the Night&quot; emphasizes the positive benefits of voluntary solitude. The term &quot;acquainted&quot; immediately makes clear that being in the darkness is a consiencious choice - and the speaker's controlled, almost familiar tone tends to focus on the comfort of darkness rather than the fear of it. Thus, Frost is able to approach darkness as a friend and as an acquaintance, resulting in us gaining an appreciation for solitude and the loneliness.</p>
<h2>Mending Wall</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/mending-wall-ken-fiery.jpg" alt="A painting of &quot;Mending Wall&quot;" /></p>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker is the neighbor to a pine farmer, the occasion is in springtime where the both of them are repairing the wall between their homes
<ul>
<li>The wall serves the function in mutually ensuring that their properties' boundaries are defined clearly</li>
<li>But why do they need to keep them separate?
<ul>
<li>This the question pondered by the main character</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The poem is a mixed combination of stream-of-consciousness (conversations going on in a character's mind) and poetic writing
<ul>
<li>That is why the poem has large chunks of colloquial prose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The wall needs to be mended - something is destroying it</li>
<li>The destroyer of the wall is no force we can grasp</li>
<li>One full stanza, no breaks, like a &quot;wall of words&quot;</li>
<li><em>&quot;And set the wall between us once again&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>This is a yearly method of voluntary separation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last line, <em>&quot;Good fences makes good neighbors&quot;</em>, is clearly an ironic statement - because Frost is implying that the fence is an obstruction to the neighbors' relationship
<ul>
<li>The shallow purpose of the wall breeds division</li>
<li>Normalization of division</li>
<li>There is unity in what they are doing, yet deep down, they want this separation - a paradox
<ul>
<li>They are working together <em>to keep the wall between them</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tradition vs. questioning tradition
<ul>
<li>The neighbor does not question the long-established tradition of laying the wall, but the character does begin to question it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>The poem explores our habitual tendency to separate &quot;us&quot; from &quot;not us&quot; and to distance ourselves from each other</li>
<li>The poem is designed to seem casual and not appear poetic (even though it is poetic)</li>
<li>The speaker isn't actually considering to take down the wall, but he is beginning to question it
<ul>
<li>It's meant to illustrate the exact moment at which this mental paradigm shift occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The title <em>&quot;Mending Wall&quot;</em> implies that their relationship is being mended, but it is still ungoing (hence why it isn't called &quot;Mended Wall&quot;) and perhaps that the small cracks they are fixing are ultimately causing causing big cracks to appear in its place
<ul>
<li>The title is almost deceptive in the way that it makes you feel</li>
<li>&quot;Mending Wall&quot; is an activity, not a physical object
<ul>
<li>It almost seems like an enjoyable, civilized, communal activity </li>
<li>But in fact it's a very primitive means of keeping two people separate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeated line - <em>&quot;something there is that doesn't love a wall</em>
<ul>
<li>The speaker feels new sense of uncomfortableness and and is troubled about the wall, and doesn't know quite how to say it - so the line comes out as an awkwardly phrased line</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many conflicts in American history are questions on what we are &quot;walling in&quot; and &quot;walling out&quot;
<ul>
<li>People feel an impulse to &quot;build walls&quot; rather than to question tradition</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Birches</h2>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<p>The poem’s speaker is an older person, who recollects the many times young boys played on the birch trees, making them bend. Yet now, he sees their bending is permanent - when a snowstorm hits, the heavy burden the birches have to bear has made them curved and bent. There is a notable contrast between the games of the children on the trees, and the snowstorm, as shown in “But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay. Ice-storms do that” It may perhaps be a metaphor for the joyous bumps of childhood, in comparison to the harsh reality and obstacles of adulthood.</p>
<p>Further on, the poem describes that “before the Truth broke in...about the ice storm” the character would like to first “bend..the branches” to prepare the trees for the storm ahead. The poem may be an observation on the fact that making ourselves flexible and training ourselves before a storm will prevent us from being harmed; while if we do not prepare, we risk making ourselves “permanently bent”</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>The poem can naturally be divided into several sections:
<ul>
<li>Lines 1-20 (the observation of the birches and the storm)</li>
<li>Lines 21-24 (landscapes, imagery of nature and the boy climbing/swinging from the tree) <em>&quot;But I was going to say when Truth broke in...&quot;</em></li>
<li>Lines 25-41 <em>&quot;Some boy too far from town to learn baseball&quot;</em></li>
<li>Lines 42-50 <em>&quot;So was I once myself a swinger of the birches...&quot;</em> (the speaker
reflecting on his youth)</li>
<li>Lines 51-54 <em>&quot;I'd like to get away from earth awhile...&quot;</em> (deliberation and introspection)</li>
<li>Lines 55-62 <em>&quot;Earth's the right place for love...&quot;</em> (the conclusion)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shifting perspectives
<ul>
<li>&quot;Seams&quot; divide the &quot;chunks&quot; of the poem</li>
<li>Section 1 - the effects of the ice storm on the birches
<ul>
<li>Violence of nature - <em>&quot;shattering, avalanching&quot;</em></li>
<li>Broken and permanent damage - <em>&quot;once they are bowed \ So long for long, they never right themselves&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Once something is under duress for long enough it doesn't recover</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disaster - <em>&quot;the inner dome of heaven had fallen&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 2 - transition
<ul>
<li>He knows this is the harshness of nature</li>
<li>But he wishes that a boy had bent them instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 3 - persona of himself (a putative character)
<ul>
<li>A boy plays on the tree alone, with joy and wonder</li>
<li>The boy climbs to the top very delicately to not tip the tree before he swings off
<ul>
<li>The grace of falling in the scene is living in harmony with nature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 4 - old age and regret
<ul>
<li>Life is a &quot;pathless wood&quot; filled with so many considerations</li>
<li>He'd like to go back to his childhood - <em>but he can't</em>
<ul>
<li>We outgrow our childhoods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 5 - wishing to leave and go back
<ul>
<li>He wants to get away from Earth for a while</li>
<li>But Earth is still where he wants to be - <em>&quot;Earth's the right place for love...&quot;</em></li>
<li>He wishes to go back and relive his childhood now that he can appreciate it
<ul>
<li>He wants to go away and come back gently</li>
<li>The author asks, wouldn't it be nice to leave Earth and come back on the soaring tops of a birch tree?</li>
<li><em>&quot;That would be good both going and coming back&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Theme - nature is a place of restoration and healing</li>
</ul>
