        <h1>Energy</h1>
<p><strong>Energy</strong> is most simply the ability to force something to move.
<strong>Mechanical energy</strong> is the energy that is due to motion or due to its position.
<em>Remember: energy is independent from momentum: they are different things.</em></p>
<h2>Types of Energy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kinetic energy is the energy of motion</li>
<li>Potential energy is energy due to position
<ul>
<li>E.g. graviational potential energy, electrical potential energy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in Energy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gravitational potential energy is directly dependent on mass, height, and the strength of the gravitational field (which is constant on Earth)</li>
<li>Kinetic energy is directly dependent on mass and the object's velocity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conservation of Energy</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>conservation of energy</strong> states that in an isolated system, the total amount of energy is conserved
<ul>
<li>Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred</li>
<li>In such a perfectly isolated system, no energy is exchanged with objects outside of the system</li>
<li>Because there are no perfectly isolated systems in reality, in practice, we just define a system as isolated within certain spacial boundaries (e.g. &quot;my system is defined as everything on and around the Earth&quot;)</li>
<li>Your decision of what <em>is</em> and <em>isn't</em> in a system are arbritrary - you can include or exclude as many things from it as you want</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>According to the conservation of energy, any <strong>increase</strong> in one type of energy is coupled with a <strong>decrease</strong> in all the other types of energy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work</strong> is a transfer of energy by a force applied along a displacement</li>
<li>Tricky points:
<ul>
<li>The displacement has to be <em>parallel</em> to the force applied, or else it isn't work!</li>
<li>The force and displacement can be both in the same and opposite directions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work is given by the equation:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
W = F\Delta x
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>When the force and the displacement are in the same direction, the work is positive</li>
<li>When the force and the displacement are in opposite directions, the work is positive</li>
<li>Based on the conservation of energy, the sum of work in a system is zero</li>
</ul>
