        <h1>Energy</h1>
<p><strong>Energy</strong> is most simply the ability to force something to move
<strong>Mechanical energy</strong> is the energy that is due to motion or due to its position.
<em>Remember: energy is independent from momentum: they are different things.</em></p>
<h2>Types of Energy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kinetic energy is the energy of motion</li>
<li>Potential energy is energy due to position
<ul>
<li>E.g. graviational potential energy, electrical potential energy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in Energy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gravitational potential energy is directly dependent on mass, height, and the strength of the gravitational field (which is constant on Earth)</li>
<li>Kinetic energy is directly dependent on mass and the object's velocity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conservation of Energy</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>conservation of energy</strong> states that in an isolated system, the total amount of energy is conserved
<ul>
<li>Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be stored and transferred</li>
<li>In such a perfectly isolated system, no energy is exchanged with objects outside of the system</li>
<li>Because there are no perfectly isolated systems in reality, in practice, we just define a system as isolated within certain spacial boundaries (e.g. &quot;my system is defined as everything on and around the Earth&quot;)</li>
<li>Your decision of what <em>is</em> and <em>isn't</em> in a system are arbritrary - you can include or exclude as many things from it as you want</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>According to the conservation of energy, any <strong>increase</strong> in one type of energy is coupled with a <strong>decrease</strong> in all the other types of energy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work</strong> is a transfer of energy by a force applied along a displacement</li>
<li>Tricky points:
<ul>
<li>The displacement has to be <em>parallel</em> to the force applied, or else it isn't work!</li>
<li>The force and displacement can be both in the same and opposite directions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work is given by the equation:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
W = F\Delta x
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>When the force and the displacement are in the same direction, the work is positive</li>
<li>When the force and the displacement are in opposite directions, the work is positive</li>
<li>Based on the conservation of energy, the sum of work in a system is zero</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modelling energy in a system at macroscopic scales</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, list the objects that are part of the system, and the objects that are not part of the system
<ul>
<li>E.g. if your hypothetical system is the solar system, you'd be listing all the planets, asteroids, rocks, gas clouds, etc. (all the interacting things within the solar system's boundaries)</li>
<li>Meanwhile, if your hypothetical system was the school, you'd be listing all the students, teachers, classrooms, books, etc.</li>
<li><em><strong>You</strong></em> decide what is part of the system, the choice of what to include is arbritrary</li>
<li>While not required, we typically assume the system to be frictionless</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, we measure the energy in the system at two positions, the initial and final position
<ul>
<li>The first bar graph is the storage of energy at one point in the system</li>
<li>The second bar graph is the storage of energy at another point in the system</li>
<li>Remember, energy is the same thing at every point in the system, it just manifests itself in different forms
<ul>
<li>The different types of energy are its modes of storage</li>
<li>E.g. kinetic energy is the kinetic storage of energy, elastic potential energy is</li>
<li>Within the system, energy can be transferred</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's an &quot;L-O-L&quot; diagram!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modelling friction in the system</h3>
<p>We can model friction (or any other force that does negative force) in a system in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could say that the energy is converted and stored in a different form (heat + sound, or what we call &quot;dissipated energy&quot;) in the system</li>
<li>But we could also say that friction is an <em>external force</em> and causes energy to leave the system</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work done by a force at an angle</h2>
<p><strong>Work</strong> is more accurately the energy transferred by a force, by the component of the force that is parallel to the direction of displacement. Since a force can be at an angle, we must find only the portion of the force.</p>
<p>$$
W = F \Delta x \cos \theta
$$</p>
<p>If the angle between the direction of displacement and the direction of the force is zero, then $\cos \theta = 1$ so $W = F \Delta x$</p>
<h2>Energy at the molecular level</h2>
<p>Energy &quot;lost&quot; is often called dissipated, internal, or thermal energy. Here, energy is stored as <strong>changes in motion and position</strong> at the molecular level that manifest as changes in temperature at the macroscopic level. There is only potential energy and kinetic energy at the microscopic level; concepts such as &quot;thermal energy&quot; disappear.</p>
<p>Temperature is a measure of the <strong>average kinetic energy</strong> of the molecules of a substance.</p>
<h2>Power and energy transfer</h2>
<p><strong>Power</strong> is the rate at which work is done:</p>
<p>$$
P = \frac{W}{t}
$$</p>
<p>Unit is Watt (that is, joules per second)</p>
<p>(Note: more generally: power is the rate of energy transfer per second)</p>
