        		<h1>Gravity</h1>
<h2>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</h2>
<p>Gravity is the force that every mass in the Universe exerts on every other mass. It is given by:</p>
<p>$$
F = - G\frac{M_1M_2}{d^2}
$$</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gravity is <em>directly proportional</em> to the masses of the objects, so if an object is twice as heavy, the force of gravity is twice as strong</li>
<li>Gravity is <em>indirectly proportional</em> to the <em>square</em> of the distance separating two objects, so if an object is twice as far away, the force of gravity is one-forth as strong</li>
</ul>
<p>We can generalize the gravitational force on Earth on every object is approximately $F_g = 10 M$ (e.g. if the object has mass 20 kg, the gravitational force exerted on the object is 200 N). This is because the Earth's gravitational field $10 \mathrm{\ N/kg}$ (approximately). However, note that this does not carry over to other planetary bodies, where we must use the law of universal gravitation instead.</p>
<h3>Why negative?</h3>
<p>Because gravity is an <strong>attractive</strong> force, it has negative potential energy, except at an infinite distance (where it is zero). The negative sign denotes that we need to add energy <em>into</em> the system to move the masses apart. The <strong>more negative</strong> the graviational potential energy, the <strong>more energy</strong> we need to put into the system to pull the two attracting objects apart. </p>
<p>So when we add positive energy into a system, we cause the gravitational position energy to become <em>less</em> negative (but it will still be a negative number). Only if we were to add infinite energy into the system, so that the masses become an infinite distance apart, will the gravitational potential energy become zero. </p>
