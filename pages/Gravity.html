        <h1>Gravity</h1>
<h2>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</h2>
<p>Gravity is the force that every mass in the Universe exerts on every other mass. It is given by:</p>
<p>$$
F = - G\frac{M_1M_2}{d^2}
$$</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gravity is <em>directly proportional</em> to the masses of the objects, so if an object is twice as heavy, the force of gravity is twice as strong</li>
<li>Gravity is <em>indirectly proportional</em> to the <em>square</em> of the distance separating two objects, so if an object is twice as far away, the force of gravity is one-forth as strong</li>
</ul>
<p>We can generalize the gravitational force on Earth on every object is approximately $10 M$ (e.g. if the object has mass 20 kg, the gravitational force exerted on the object is 200 N). This is because the Earth's gravitational field $10 \mathrm{\ N/kg}$ (approximately). However, note that this does not carry over to other planetary bodies, where we must use the law of universal gravitation instead.</p>
<h3>Why negative?</h3>
<p>Gravitational potential energy is 0 at an infinite distance. As the distance increases, the magnitude of the GPE decreases, meaning it takes less work to pull the two masses apart.</p>
<p>Potential energy is energy that can <em>potentially</em> be used.</p>
