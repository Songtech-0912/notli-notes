        <h1>Economics</h1>
<p>Economics is all about <strong>choices</strong>. The questions economics answers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we need to <em>make</em> choices?</li>
<li>How can we make the <em>right</em> choices?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scarcity</h2>
<p>The <strong>basic economic problem</strong> is that all resources are scarce.</p>
<p>A resource is scarce if there is not enough of it to fulfill human needs.</p>
<p>Scare resources come at an <strong>opportunity cost</strong>: what you give up to acquire or do something.</p>
<p>When a firm has an option to produce a certain quantity of two goods, $A$, and $B$, the opportunity cost is given by:</p>
<p>$$
C_{\Delta A} = \frac{\Delta B}{\Delta A}
$$</p>
<p>$$
C_{\Delta B} = \frac{1}{C_{\Delta A}}
$$</p>
<p>Where $C$ is the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of the good, $\Delta A$ is the change in production of Good A, and $\Delta B$ is the change in production of Good B.</p>
<p>Firms have limited resources and thus must decide on what goods (or services) to produce (or provide).</p>
<p>The <strong>Production Possibilities Frontier</strong> is a curve showcasing the combinations of goods (or services) that a firm can produce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Points <em>on</em> the curve are maximising (making the best use of) all resources</li>
<li>Points <em>inside</em> the curve are inefficient</li>
<li>Points <em>outside</em> the curve are impossible</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the production possibilities frontier, we can find the opportunity cost of making a certain quantity of each product.</p>
<p>Increasing the factors of production <strong>shifts</strong> the production possibilities frontier outward, as additional inputs create high production possibilities. The same is true vice-versa.</p>
<p>Changing character preferences does <strong>not</strong> change the production possibilities frontier, but there is a <em>movement</em> of a point on the graph.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p><strong>Trade</strong> is an exchange of goods or services between individuals, groups, or countries.</p>
<p>Two groups should trade if one is <strong>better</strong> at making something than the other.</p>
<p>If one group has an <strong>absolute advantage</strong>, it can make <em>more</em> of one product in a time period.</p>
<p>If one group has a <strong>comparative advantage</strong>, it can make one product <em>more efficiently</em> - that is, it has a lower opportunity cost making that product.</p>
<p>Unless two trading parties have the same opportunity cost, each will have a comparative advantage in producing their specific good.</p>
<h2>Solving for comparative advantage</h2>
<p>The opportunity cost would be the number of units of one product forgone in producing one more unit of the other product. We can caluclate it:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>input</strong> problems (factors/inputs used): <strong>other</strong> value <strong>under</strong> (IOU)</li>
<li>For <strong>output</strong> problems (product quantity made): <strong>other</strong> value <strong>over</strong> (OOO)</li>
</ul>
<p>For output problems using &quot;OOO&quot;, the opportunity cost of one product is the reciprocal of the opportunity cost of the other product.</p>
<p>We can also use the formula for opportunity cost we mentioned earlier:</p>
<p>$$
C_{\Delta A} = \frac{\Delta B}{\Delta A}, C_{\Delta B} = \frac{1}{C_{\Delta A}}
$$</p>
<h2>Consequences of comparative advantage</h2>
<p>If one party has a comparative advantage in producing one good/service, and the other party has a comparative advantage in producing the other good/service, they should <strong>specialize</strong> and <strong>trade</strong>.</p>
<p>Trade benefits everyone in society because it allows everyone to consume outside of their production possibilities frontier. Even a country with an absolute advantage in producing all goods would still benefit from trade with other countries. Whereas, countries and individuals that attempt self-sufficiency (producing everything on their own) will end up poorer and having less.</p>
<p>However, for trade to be <strong>mutually beneficial</strong>, it has to be an amount between the opportunity costs of both parties. Each party must receive a good at a lower opportunity cost than producing the good on its own. In other terms, the quantity $Q_x$ of a good $x$ traded would be between party $A$ and party $B$'s opportunity cost for making one unit of that good:</p>
<p>$$
A_{C_x} &lt; Q_x &lt; B_{C_x}
$$</p>
<p>If we have a good $X$ is traded between party $A$ and $B$. The opportunity cost of producing 1 more unit of good $X$ for $A$ would be $A_{C_x}$, and the opportunity cost of producing 1 more unit of good $Y$ for $B$ would be $B_{C_x}$. The quantity traded would have to be between $A_{C_x}$ and $B_{C_x}$.</p>
<p>Trading like this allows both parties to enjoy <strong>gains from trade</strong>.</p>
<h2>Utility</h2>
<p><strong>Utility</strong> is the satisfaction derived from consuming a product. We measure utility in <strong>utils</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Marginal utility</strong> is the utility derived from consuming an <strong>additional</strong> product</p>
<p>As products are consumed, total utility increases at a decreasing rate, eventually becoming negative. This is the <strong>law of diminishing marginal utility</strong>.</p>
<p>The process of weighing the costs and benefits of consuming a product is called <strong>marginal analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>While utility is a very idealized model, it is used to show that rational people do make choices based on maximizing satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Maximising utility</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start by finding the marginal utility per dollar for each item</li>
<li>Starting at zero, decide what to buy next by identifying what will bring more marginal utility per dollar.</li>
<li>Repeat the previous step until the budget is extinguished.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Assumptions of Market Analysis</h2>
<p>We always have these assumptions when analyzing any market:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are numerous buyers and sellers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The good being sold is nearly identical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prices and qualities are known or freely accessible, and both buyers and sellers have perfect economic knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The market is <strong>perfectly competitive</strong>; that is, the market price of a good cannot be controlled by any buyer or seller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no barriers to market entry</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some markets in real life are close to perfect markets; take, for example, the market for fresh oranges. Others are very far from a perfect market; for instance, the market for commerical jetliners. However, in economics, we always assume a perfect market, regardless of the actual state of the market in real life.</p>
<h2>Demand</h2>
<p><strong>Demand</strong> is the amount of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase.</p>
<p>For instance, customers may be willing to buy 3 books for 20 dollars. Thus, the <em>demand</em> for books at a price of 20 dollars is 3 books.</p>
<p>The <strong>law of demand</strong> is that as the price of a good increases, its quantity demanded decreases. This can be visualized on a demand curve, like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/ui2ITGwsWZTY.png?o=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <strong>change in quantity demanded</strong> is a move along the demand curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/Jk2xe2GVOGnE.png?o=1" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Supply</h2>
<p><strong>Supply</strong> is the amount of a good that firms are willing and able to sell.</p>
<p>For instance, a publishing firm may be willing to sell 3 books for 20 dollars. Thus, the <em>supply</em> for books at a price of 20 dollars is 3 books.</p>
<p>The <strong>law of supply</strong> is that as the price of a good increases, its quantity supplied increases. This can be visualized on a supply curve, like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/ef1joFK4eoVX.png?o=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <strong>change in quantity supplied</strong> is a move along the supply curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/N8yIOUh3l1ap.png?o=1" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Types of goods</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Subtitutes</strong> are goods where <em>increasing</em> the price of the first good causes consumers to buy less of the first good and more of the second good (e.g. pepsi and coke)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complements</strong> are goods where <em>increasing</em> the price of the first good <em>increases</em> the demand of the first good and <em>decreases</em> the demand of the second good (e.g. milk and cereal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Normal goods</strong> are goods consumers buy <em>more</em> of if they gain more income</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inferior goods</strong> are goods consumer buy <em>less</em> of if they gain more income</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shifting demand</h2>
<p>Demand is determined by 5 factors, collectively called the <strong>determinants of demand</strong> (easily remembered with the acronym I-N-E-P-T):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Income</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of buyers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expectations of buyers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prices of substitutes/complements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tastes of consumers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>change</strong> (or shift) in <strong>demand</strong> is a situation where the entire demand curve shifts as a result of a change in the determinants of demand. A decrease in demand is a leftward shift of the demand curve, and an increase is a rightward shift.</p>
<h2>Shifting supply</h2>
<p>Supply is determined by 4 factors, collectively called the <strong>determinants of supply</strong> (easily remembered with the acronym N-I-T-E):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of sellers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input prices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expectations of sellers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>change in supply</strong> is a situation where the entire supply curve shifts as a result of a change in the determinants of supply.</p>
<h2>Supply and demand</h2>
<p>When we combine a supply curve and a demand curve, we have a supply-demand curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/WIpJo1YfAdww.png?o=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>At the point where the quantity supplied is <em>equal</em> to the quantity demanded, we have the <strong>economic equilibrium</strong>. The price of the good at that point is the <strong>equilibrium price</strong>, and its associated quantity is the <strong>equilibrium quantity</strong>. A market is at its most efficient (maximising utility for everyone) when it is at equilibrium.</p>
<p>At prices above the equilibrum price, the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. Thus, we have a <strong>surplus</strong>. At prices below the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied. Thus, we have a <strong>shortage</strong>.</p>
<h2>Shifting supply and demand</h2>
<p>When both supply and demand <em>increase</em>, we know (from drawing supply-demand graphs) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The increase in supply by itself causes a <strong>reduction in price</strong> and an <strong>increase in quantity</strong></li>
<li>The increase in demand by itself causes an <strong>increase in price</strong> and an <strong>increase in quantity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Combined, this means that an increase in <strong>both</strong> supply and demand <strong>must</strong> cause quantity to rise. However, we can't be sure whether the price will increase or decrease without knowing how <em>much</em> the curves shifted, as supply and demand have opposite effects on price.</p>
<p>When both the demand and supply curves shift, the curve that shifts by the larger magnitude determines the effect on the equilibrium.</p>
<p>Similarly, when both supply and demand <em>decrease</em>, we know (from drawing supply-demand graphs) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The decrease in supply by itself causes an <strong>increase in price</strong> and a <strong>decrease in quantity</strong></li>
<li>The decrease in demand by itself causes a <strong>decrease in price</strong> and a <strong>decrease in quantity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Combined, this means that a decrease in <strong>both</strong> supply and demand <strong>must</strong> cause quantity to fall. However, again, we <em>can't</em> be sure whether the price will increase or decrease, as supply and demand have opposite effects on price.</p>
<p>Thus, as a summary:</p>
