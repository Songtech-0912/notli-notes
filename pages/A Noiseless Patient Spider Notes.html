        		<h1><em>A Noiseless Patient Spider</em> Notes</h1>
<p>Jacky Song</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The continuing metaphor of the spider as the author's being</li>
<li>The imagery surrounding the spider's slow handiwork</li>
<li>The emphasis of &quot;noiseless&quot; and &quot;patient&quot;</li>
<li>The numerous uses of repetition and descriptive adjectives</li>
<li>Many words to describe fine connections:
<ul>
<li>Ductile</li>
<li>Filament</li>
<li>Gossamer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lots of sonorous words</li>
<li>Finding yourself and your place in an endless world (self-actualization)</li>
<li>The patient path</li>
<li>Surrounded by people and yet feel detached</li>
<li>Humanist view of the world</li>
<li>The spider is lonely but is still willing to work on</li>
<li>The central figure is very much challenged by his circumstances</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quotations</h2>
<p><strong>Identify and select what you think are the most powerful images or descriptions or ideas in the poem. Briefly explain why.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;filament, filament, filament&quot;</em> - repeated to show that the author's pesistence is unending</li>
<li><em>&quot;the vacant vast surroundings&quot;</em> - the difficulties of the immensely large world</li>
<li><em>&quot;musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres&quot;</em> - the author wishes to connect and yet he is not able to</li>
<li><em>&quot;Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere&quot;</em> - idealism, a hope that ends with optimism at the end</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>What ideas and feelings emerge from the poem? What is the speakerâ€™s attitude and response to her situation?  How would you explain what this poem is about?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The poem is structured into 2 sections - the first part is about the spider, and using the spider as a metaphor, and the second part is an address by the author to his soul</li>
<li>The spider is endlessly trying, flinging filament after filament even though no thread sticks
<ul>
<li>The verbs are ongoing - there is no end to them</li>
<li>The lines are very long - this is a poem about trying to make a connection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The author sees himself as the spider - his own soul is in open space
<ul>
<li>He only needs 1 thread to stick for him to have his anchor point and finally succeed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like undertaking the American Dream</li>
</ul>
<p>The poem is a self-reflection by the author, who observes a spider tirelessly spinning his web in fruition. The author notices that even while the filaments do not attach, the spider ceaselessly continues on. The author urges himself to go on, continuing to realize himself in the hopes of connecting himself - realizing his spiritual ambitions.</p>
