        <h1>Political Institutions</h1>
<p><em>This is the second unit of the AP Comparative Politics Course</em></p>
<h2>Nigeria: transitional democracy</h2>
<h3>State Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>1st republic - parliamentary democracy</li>
<li>Second republic 1979 (US-like system)</li>
<li>Third republic was supposed to happen after military dictatorships, but never happened</li>
<li>Fourth republic - slightly modified presidential model
<ul>
<li>Strong executive</li>
<li>Bicameral legislature - House of Representatives and Senate</li>
<li>Independent judiciary</li>
<li>Constitutional rule of law</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skewed Federalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federalism <em>de jure</em> but not really <em>de facto</em></li>
<li>Funding is controlled by the federal government - with <em>fiscal federalism</em> as all oil and gas is property of the federal government</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issues with the institutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>The executive reigns supreme over the legislative and judiciary</li>
<li>Historically, Nigerian presidents have consolidated their power</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Cleavages</h3>
<ul>
<li>The north is predominantly Muslim and the south is predominantly Christian</li>
<li>Under Nigeria's system, there are religious Sharia law courts that individuals may choose to use instead of the secular law courts system</li>
<li>Nigeria is composed of many ethnic groups, but the three biggest ones are Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, which also dominate national politics, at the expense of other ethnic groups</li>
<li>Boko Haram (a terrorist islamist group) is causing a major insurgency within the northeastern regions and has been a major issue for the past two decades</li>
</ul>
<h3>Corruption</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clientelism</strong> dominates Nigerian politics - using state funds to keep oneself in office</li>
<li>Just like the US in the 1890s, wealthy and powerful patrons fund candidates to get into office, and successful candidates then accede to the demands and whims of their patrons</li>
<li>There is a lot of money in Nigeria, but it is poorly distributed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mexico: transitional democracy</h2>
<h3>State Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>1910 revolution and 1917 constitution</li>
<li>State corporatism with single-party rule until the 2000s</li>
<li>Now a multiparty democracy
<ul>
<li>Bicameral legislature - Chamber of Deputies and Senate</li>
<li>President with one six-year term</li>
<li>Strong executive branch but with local states and governments</li>
<li>Gender quota (30% women candidates) for Congress since 2002</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
