        <h1>Political Institutions</h1>
<p><em>This is the second unit of the AP Comparative Politics Course</em></p>
<h2>Nigeria: transitional democracy</h2>
<h3>State Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>1st republic - parliamentary democracy</li>
<li>Second republic 1979 (US-like system)</li>
<li>Third republic was supposed to happen after military dictatorships, but never happened</li>
<li>Fourth republic - slightly modified presidential model
<ul>
<li>Strong executive, 2 four-year terms and with the authority to appoint ministers</li>
<li>Bicameral legislature - House of Representatives and Senate, Senate confirms presidential appointments</li>
<li>Independent judiciary</li>
<li>Constitutional rule of law</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skewed Federalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federalism <em>de jure</em> but not really <em>de facto</em></li>
<li>Funding is controlled by the federal government - with <em>fiscal federalism</em> as all oil and gas is property of the federal government</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issues with the institutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>The executive reigns supreme over the legislative and judiciary</li>
<li>Historically, Nigerian presidents have consolidated their power</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Cleavages</h3>
<ul>
<li>The north is predominantly Muslim and the south is predominantly Christian</li>
<li>Under Nigeria's system, there are religious Sharia law courts that individuals may choose to use instead of the secular law courts system</li>
<li>Nigeria is composed of many ethnic groups, but the three biggest ones are Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, which also dominate national politics, at the expense of other ethnic groups</li>
<li>Boko Haram (a terrorist islamist group) is causing a major insurgency within the northeastern regions and has been a major issue for the past two decades</li>
</ul>
<h3>Corruption</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clientelism</strong> dominates Nigerian politics - using state funds to keep oneself in office</li>
<li>Just like the US in the 1890s, wealthy and powerful patrons fund candidates to get into office, and successful candidates then accede to the demands and whims of their patrons</li>
<li>There is a lot of money in Nigeria, but it is poorly distributed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mexico: transitional democracy</h2>
<h3>State Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>1910 revolution and 1917 constitution</li>
<li>State corporatism with single-party rule until the 2000s</li>
<li>Now a multiparty democracy
<ul>
<li>Bicameral legislature - Chamber of Deputies and Senate</li>
<li>President with one six-year term</li>
<li>Strong executive branch but with local states and governments</li>
<li>Gender quota (30% women candidates) for Congress since 2002</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Russia: hybrid regime</h2>
<h3>State Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federal system (at least in theory)</li>
<li>89 regions with unequal distribution of power to regions (asymmetric federalism)</li>
<li>Dual executive
<ul>
<li>President (head of state) with much more power</li>
<li>Theoretically can be impeached but has <em>de facto</em> political immunity</li>
<li>Prime minister (head of government) appointed by President with much less power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legislature
<ul>
<li>The Duma is the lower house, equivalent to the House of Reps.</li>
<li>The Federation Council is the upper house, somewhat like the Senate, but typically does very little</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods of improving democracy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Establish full and complete independence of all state, federal, and appellate courts, especially for the Supreme Court, with justices prohibited from any previous ties with the government </li>
<li>Ensure that the Supreme Court’s ruling has the force of law by making its decisions binding and enshrining the right to judicial review in the Constitution</li>
<li>Enshrining the freedom of information and the ability of citizens to make FOI requests in the Constitution and creating the competent institution(s) to respond to FOI requests</li>
<li>Strengthening existing regulations over use of money by the government and public officials</li>
<li>Creating a system of anonymous corruption reporting for all citizens to have access to</li>
<li>Using the Supreme Court to bring drug lords to justice with the assistance of local and federal security forces</li>
<li>Strengthening human rights by applying human rights to appropriate legislation</li>
<li>Formally providing protections against torture or inhumane detainment in domestic military operations and conducting relevant court-martials for soldiers acting in violation of these regulations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Iran: authoritarian regime</h2>
<h3>State Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Majlis - democratically-elected parliament of Iran</li>
<li>President - head of government with limited power</li>
<li>Supreme Leader - head of state with near-absolute power</li>
<li>The Guardian Council
<ul>
<li>An unelected body of 12 members, and has considerable influence</li>
<li>Has the power to qualify or disqualify candidates for the Assembly of Experts, the President, and the Majlis (Iranian Parliament)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Assembly of Experts
<ul>
<li>An unelected body of 88 members which has the sole power to appoint the Supreme Leader</li>
<li>Its members are chosen directly or indirectly by the Supreme Leader</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Iranian Political System</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Supreme Leader (head of state)</th><th>President (head of government)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Who?</td><td><strong>Ayatollah Ali Khamanei</strong> - only <em>second</em> supreme leader in Iran's history</td><td><strong>President Raisi</strong> - background of religious cleric (hardliner), very anti-West, protegè of Khamenei + possible successor</td></tr>
<tr><td>Powers</td><td>Put forth candidates, control public opinion (to a certain extent), control public officials, and give the final say on almost all state matters</td><td>Domestic policy and a limited amount of executive power</td></tr>
<tr><td>Election?</td><td>Appointed by the Assembly of Experts (who can theoretically dismiss him, but are actually submissive), who are vetted by the Guardian council, which is itself (indirectly) appointed by the Supreme Leader</td><td>National election - winning candidate typically endorsed by Supreme Leader</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Iran-US History</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Eisenhower administration (1953) sponsors a coup overthrows popularly-elected Iranian prime minister Mossadegh, and installs the despotic but pro-West Shah</li>
<li>The Iranian Revolution (1979) overthrows the Shah</li>
<li>The Ayatollah then seizes power and turns Iran into a theocracy</li>
</ul>
<h2>China: authoritarian regime</h2>
<h3>State Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Communist Party of China vets all candidates</li>
<li>Legislature
<ul>
<li>National People's Congress (theoretically) approves of the President and all legislation</li>
<li>But realistically it is just a rubber-stamping body</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rule by law, not rule of law</li>
<li>Highly efficient policymaking but no oversight</li>
<li>Freedom and liberty is not as much of a deal for the Chinese people</li>
</ul>
