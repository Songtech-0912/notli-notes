        <h1>AP Language &amp; Composition Notes</h1>
<h2>Unit 1: Rhetoric</h2>
<p><strong>Rhetoric</strong> is <em>the study of writing or speaking as a means of communication or persuasion.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is the study of effective communication through the understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the speaker </li>
<li>the audience</li>
<li>the situation</li>
<li>the text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your rhetorical choices are shaped by your <strong>message</strong>, your <strong>identity</strong>, your <strong>words</strong>, your <strong>audience</strong>, and your <strong>circumstances</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each aspect of rhetoric has an <em>interconnected effect</em> on each other. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good communicator understands how these aspects connect and uses them accordingly based on the <strong>rhetorical situation</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many aspects in speaking and communicating that are involved in rhetoric, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>our tone/attitude</li>
<li>our word choice/diction</li>
<li>use of imagery</li>
<li>allusions/references</li>
<li>evidence</li>
<li>mannerisms/gestures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analyzing the 5 aspects of rhetoric</h3>
<h4>1. Rhetorical Situation</h4>
<p>A series of conditions that a speaker takes in mind while writing or giving a speech. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker's message</li>
<li>The speaker's identity</li>
<li>The speaker's audience</li>
<li>The circumstances of the speech</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Exigence</h4>
<p>The issue, problem, or situation that causes or prompts someone to write or give a speech.</p>
<h4>3. Claim</h4>
<p>The opinion, idea, or assertion held by the speaker and supported by evidence and/or persuasive means.</p>
<h4>4. Warrant</h4>
<p>The unspoken assumption(s) recognized by the audience that one can base a claim on.</p>
<h3>Rhetorical Devices</h3>
<p>Rhetorical Devices are proven strategies that increase the persuasiveness of rhetoric. Here are some of these devices:</p>
<h4>Allusion/referencing</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A reference to a past event, text, or piece of art</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used to make a point by drawing connections or contrasts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be subtle or direct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, my dog is Dr Jekyll; other times, he's Mr Hyde.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Repetition</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The repeated use of the same word, phrase or idea</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used to emphasize and create both a structural and emotional effect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually very obvious and intentionally easy to spot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have a dream...I have a dream...I have a dream...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Parallel Structure/parallelism</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The repetition of form, wording, or structure</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used to give prose and poetry a sense of symmetry and balance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Antithesis</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A form of parallelism, using words that are the opposites of, or strongly contrasted with, each other</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used to express a contrast or opposition of ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example: </p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The arrangement of words in a phrase or sentence, or the structuring of a sentence</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used to vary the author's language (i.e. make it less boring by not repeating words all the time), change the impact of a description, or strengthen certain points being made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax can also dictate where the reader reads and pauses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, the effect of syntax is not evident until you rearrange the sentence to something else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What light from yonder window breaks? </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The normal syntax of this sentence should be <em>what light is breaking from yonder window?</em> But Shakespeare deliberately <em>changes</em> the syntax to make a greater impact.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ethos</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The level of credibility, authority, and respect of a speaker has while asserting a point</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used to convince or connect to an audience based on the authority or credibility of the persuader</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example (italics added for emphasis): </p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>As a doctor</em>, I am <em>qualified</em> to tell you that this course of treatment will likely generate the best results.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Metaphor &amp; Simile</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Using an object, person, or idea to describe another, based on a shared property or trait</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used to suggest a likeness or analogy of the compared objects, people, or ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often grouped together and related to one specific topic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Notice how many metaphors and similes in this quote are related to nature</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rhetorical Questions</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Questions addressed to the reader that are not meant to be answered in real time</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Often, the question has an implied answer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used to signal an understanding of an author's point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? If you prick us, do we not bleed, if you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Writing about and analysing rhetoric</h2>
<p>AP English places a strong emphasis on the <strong>speechmaker's/writer's awareness of the larger audience and broader ideas at play.</strong> Here are some ways to show your understanding of rhetoric when analysing it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Repeating the word <em>audience</em> several times in your paragraph</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making use of supporting evidence - as much as possible - is crucial</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting evidence needs to be <em>specific</em>, not a generalized reference</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Free Response Question Essay Structure</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>1 sentence as opening statement - must be <strong>arguable</strong>, <em>not</em> just a statement of fact. This has to be a statement in the form of &quot;<em>why</em> did this matter&quot;.</p>
<p>1-2 sentences providing context to your argument.</p>
<p>Contextualization (for historical-based essays only) - Mention specific references from a time period. How does it tie back to its thesis?</p>
<h4>Body Paragraphs</h4>
<p>Topic sentence: 1 sentence - use short snippets of supporting evidence</p>
<p><em>The topic sentence cannot be too specific, such as &quot;in this paragraph, the author uses metaphor for literary effects.&quot;. Something that specific will leave you with not enough to write about. It has to be about the <strong>general effect</strong> of the device, such as &quot;within this paragraph, the author illustrates the emotional nature and significance of the main event, and meaning&quot;</em> </p>
<p>Evidence &amp; Explanation: 3-4 sentences - use short quotes for supporting evidence and alternate between evidence and explanation. Do <em>not</em> confuse explanation with summary; explanation is <em>why</em> an author* makes a literary choice, rather than which choices they choose to make. Also, try to extract information from a single word or a single phrase, instead of a general sentence; in order words, be <em>discrimminating</em> in your use of evidence.</p>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> show understanding of rhetorical situation and factors influencing the work.</p>
<p>You <strong>should</strong> also include evidence beyond the document - the outside information and background knowledge.</p>
<p>Commentary: 2-3 sentences examining the effects of the author's literary choices. Use <em>smooth transitions</em> between each point to weave your analysis and your background information into your paragraph. You <em>must</em> communicate your ideas <em>clearly</em>, because the marking process for AP essays have no patience for tedious and unclear explanations.</p>
<p>Good word choices for contextualization/transition: elsewhere, alongside, beyond, hereafter, furthermore, equally importantly moreover; influences, represents, expresses, intends, demonstrates, illustrates, specifically, in any event, in the first place, in the second place, as a result, in brief, on the whole</p>
<h4>Conclusion (no more than 4 sentences; no less than 2 sentences)</h4>
<p>1 sentence summary of your thesis (shorter than your opening statement)</p>
<p>1-2 sentences of explaining &quot;why my essay matters&quot; such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a universal truth explored in your essay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a connection to another topic (how both are similar/different/affected each other)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contrasting your essay with another topic</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips to quickly improve your writing</h3>
<h4>Improving sophistication</h4>
<p>The sophistication score in AP is determined by whether you adhere to expected stylistic conventions. Among these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalization and use of title case </li>
<li>Using last names of authors and major characters</li>
<li>Using appropriate transitional terms</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixing any of the above is crucial in presenting you essay as a polished work.</p>
<h4>Clarifying your thesis</h4>
<p>Your thesis is the first thing that exam markers are going to see, so make sure it stands out. </p>
<p>Firstly, you should avoid the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using too narrow a topic, such as one device
<ul>
<li>E.g. <em>The author's use of imagery in this work signifies...</em> is far too specific to be a topic sentence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, you are encouraged to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your thesis directly about (or at the very least, <em>include</em>) the exigence of the work you are responding to
<ul>
<li>E.g. <em>Stoker utilizes the awareness of his position in comparison to Whitman to provoke the attention of Whitman</em> uses the exigence, <em>[for] provoking the attention of Whitman</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Show awareness of the &quot;bigger picture&quot; of a work - that there's more to it that what's on a page
<ul>
<li>You can do this by either <em>addresing</em> the context of adding <em>personal experiences</em> to the original rhetorical work</li>
<li>E.g. <em>Ironically, Stoker became famous in later years, and we may find it unusual that he had been so hesistant in writing to Whitman in his youth</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unit 2: Romanticism</h2>
<p>Romanticism describes a wide category of literature, characterized by the embrace of emotion and the unexplored.</p>
<h3>Features and Devices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Imagination and Escapism
<ul>
<li>Optimistic depictions of society</li>
<li>Settings of pure beauty and sheltered from harsh industrial conditions</li>
<li>Escaping and journeying from cities</li>
<li>Set in somewhat illogical and unrealistic places, sometimes even supernatural</li>
<li>Prominent use of rich imagery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individuality
<ul>
<li>Embrace of intuition and emotion and rejection of traditional logical thought and reason</li>
<li>Formation of new identity independent from mainland Europe
Natural as a source of spirituality
Looking to the past for wisdom
Championing the common man as the hero</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notable Points</h3>
<p>Initially, the Puritans lived in fear of nature and regarded it as supernatural and dangerous. Instead, the Puritans were focused on many observances and strict, inflexible laws. Whereas American Romanticist appealed to the same spirituality, but offered a new path into spirtual fulfillment through the natural world.</p>
<h2>Unit 3: The Odyssey</h2>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Non-chronological - starts in the middle of the story (<em>in media res</em>)</li>
<li>It assumed that the reader already knew <em>some details</em> about Odysseus's story already
* For that reason, the story begins in a moment that readers could already recognize</li>
<li>At the start of the originl text, Odysseus is the sole survivor of his crew, and he has not seen home for twenty years</li>
<li>His crew is a symbol of Odysseus's negative equalities, who are shed away in order for Odysseus to become the best person he could be</li>
<li>He can no longer be the warrior he was at Troy; he has to become the husband and father and king he has to be once he goes home</li>
<li>Aeolus, god of the wind, gave Odysseus the gift of a bag of powerful winds to guide his ship home to Ithaca
* However, Aeolus also warns Odysseus that the bag must stay shut and the winds entrapped until the right time</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opening</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cautionary Tales:
<ul>
<li>Odysseus is trapped on Ogygia with the beautiful Titan goddess Calypso</li>
<li>Agamemnon is murdered by his wife's lover after returning home from the Trojan War
<ul>
<li>Introduces and establishes the theme of infidelity</li>
<li>Causes Odysseus to question what his wife is doing and question her fidelity</li>
<li>How &quot;getting home&quot; can become a sad story as the home is no longer &quot;home&quot;</li>
<li>Things at &quot;home&quot; were not under control and this leads to devastation
<ul>
<li>Agamemnon's household is betrayed by his wife's infidelity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warns Odysseus of the dangers of his unfaithfulness to his wife as Odysseus was having an affair with Calypso</li>
<li>Explained away in the story by Odysseus's powerlessness in comparison to Calypso's supernatural charm and power</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Odysseus and Polyphemus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Polyphemus was a man-eating cyclops (one of the sons of Poseidon)</li>
<li>Odysseus arrives on the island of Polyphemus, and does not show proper hospitality by occupying Polyphemus's cave-house and eating his food</li>
<li>Odysseus then tricks Polyphemus by calling him &quot;nobody&quot; and stabs him in the eye</li>
<li>Poseidon now has a grudge against Odysseus</li>
<li>Communicates that Odysseus and his crew need to rid themselves of more bad traits - in this case, greed and disrespecting hospitality - or they won't get home
<ul>
<li>In Greek times, hospitality was incredibly important because travelling on the road was inherently dangerous</li>
<li>Thus, when you arrived at any stop during travel, you relied on your host's hospitality to stay alive</li>
<li>Being a gracious host/guest was very important because of this</li>
<li>Teaches Odysseus a bitter lesson how to behave appropriately in a house instead of relying on the greed and selfishness that has kept him alive in war</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Winds of Aeolus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aeolus is given a bag of winds to blow his ship home by Aeolus, the wind god</li>
<li>He steers the ship by himself for 9 days, coming within sight of Ithaca, but falls asleep of exhaustion</li>
<li>Some of his crew, believing the bag of winds to be plundered treasure, and seeing Odysseus asleep, open the bag</li>
<li>The winds blow his ship, far away
<ul>
<li>Again shows that Odysseus and his crew is not ready to go home and isn't the man he needs to be</li>
<li>Symbolizes that taking what is not yours - a warrior in the home - needs MORE work</li>
<li>Odysseus still has to learn to be a civilized civilian</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>On Circe's Island</h3>
<ul>
<li>Odysseus lands on Circe's island</li>
<li>His men are turned by the sorceress Circe into pigs and beasts
<ul>
<li>Literally, his men are &quot;making pigs of themselves&quot;</li>
<li>Reflecting the still-uncivilized instincts of Odysseus and his crew</li>
<li>They need refinement before returning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Odysseus tries to resist Circe's spells</li>
<li>However, Circe offers to free Odysseus's men and keep them safe if Odysseus becomes her lover</li>
<li>Odysseus relents to Circe's demands
<ul>
<li>Odysseus technically is unfaithful</li>
<li>However he is still &quot;faithful&quot; because he has no choice, and is under the influence of the sorceress's powers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the suitors will begin to occupy Penelope's (and Odysseus's) palace
<ul>
<li>They take advantage of (and abused) the customs of hospitality to dwell and live in Odysseus's palace</li>
<li>However, Penelope remains faithful</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hard Truths from Tiresias</h3>
<ul>
<li>Odysseus is told by Circe to find the way to Ithaca by visiting the underworld and consulting the ghost of the prophet Tiresias</li>
<li>The blind prophet Tiresias to sail toward the clashing rocks and whirlpool of Scylla and Charybdis, and warns Odysseus of his arrogance and folly
<ul>
<li>Tiresias's prophecies are always hard to accept and to believe</li>
<li>But these prophecies are always true, and often doom the hero to failure</li>
<li>It introduces the mythological motif of the wise character who is able to &quot;see clearly&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Odysseus also sees his mother, who brings Odysseus news that Penelope is well
<ul>
<li>But she also warns Odysseus that the suitors were coming to steal his wife and his kingdom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Athena comes to Odysseus's palace in Ithaca to visit Odysseus's now 20-year-old son, Telemachus, and rouse him for kingship
<ul>
<li>Athena transforms herself into human form, as gods cannot appear to mortals in their full form</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Telemachus reacts when he sees Athena, even in her disguised form as a stranger - &quot;He could almost see his magnificent father, here...&quot;
<ul>
<li>He treats Athena with hospitality and as a guest of honor</li>
<li>Shows Telemechus has sight beyond sight - he recognizes something that others don't</li>
<li>A motif of a &quot;king/queen in disguise&quot; as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scylla and Charybdis</h3>
<ul>
<li>As foretold by Tiresias</li>
<li>On each side, there is an invincible monster, indestructable by the sword and unshieldable
<ul>
<li>On the left, is Scylla, a six-headed sea-dragon that plucks men from their ships and devours them</li>
<li>On the right, is Charybdis, a monster that creates a massive whirlpool and sucks humans to their doom</li>
<li>Essentially, Odysseus cannot avoid either side, and he unavoidably loses all of his men (in the original text he still had some crew members left but he loses all of them shortly after)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>On Ogygia with Calypso</h3>
<ul>
<li>He washes up on Ogygia, the island of the goddess Calypso, shipwrecked and alone
<ul>
<li>Remember, his crew is a representation of the types of traits and habits he needs to get rid of</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He becomes the prisoner in the clutches of Calypso, in the same way as Circe
<ul>
<li>And as with Circe, he becomes Calypso's lover</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>This is the location of the original beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Athena meets Odysseus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Odysseus is rescued by Athena, and Athena teleports him back to Ithaca</li>
<li>Athena also disguises Odysseus as an old beggar to see the condition of his household</li>
<li>His son Telemachus treats him very well and shows him proper hospitality</li>
<li>Yet Telemachus and Odysseus are shunned and mocked by the Suitors alike</li>
<li>Finally, Odysseus is &quot;discovered&quot; by Eurycleia, his housemaid, though he forbids her from telling</li>
<li>Penelope also shows hospitality towards Odysseus</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Contest of Odysseus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Penelope tests the Suitors with a contest for her hand in marriage:
<ul>
<li>Each must have the physical strength to string Odysseus's bow</li>
<li>Each must also have a stable hand to be able to shoot between a line of 12 axes</li>
<li>It's meant to be an impossible contest to all but Odysseus</li>
<li>Sets up dramatic tension for Odysseus's return</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After all suitors fail to pass the test, Odysseus does both tasks easily
<ul>
<li>His disguise is lifted and he is shown in his true glory</li>
<li>With Telemachus, he slaughters the suitors</li>
<li>Final cleansing of the &quot;undeserving&quot; suitors to restore the home of its purity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reunited with Penelope</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finally, Penelope sees Odysseus - she questions Odysseus's identity by asking him to move their bed to another room</li>
<li>Odysseus responds that this would be impossible, because one of the legs of their bed was the trunk of a living olive tree - a symbol of loyalty and devotion</li>
<li>Penelope accepts that Odysseus, her husband, has truly returned home, and they embrace</li>
</ul>
