        <h1>Trigonometry</h1>
<h2>Angles and Measures</h2>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>angle</strong> is the space between two rays that share a common endpoint</li>
<li>The point where the two rays of an angle meet is called the <strong>vertex</strong></li>
<li>The starting side of an angle is its <strong>initial side</strong>, and the ending side of an angle is its <strong>terminal side</strong></li>
<li>Positive angles go counterclockwise from the initial side, negative angles go clockwise from the initial side</li>
<li>An angle is in <strong>standard position</strong> if its vertex is located at the origin and one ray is on the positive x-axis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Coterminal Angles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coterminal angles</strong> start from standard position and share the same terminal side</li>
<li>Two angles that are coterminal satisfy $\angle \beta = \angle \alpha \pm 360^\circ x$
<ul>
<li>E.g. they can add up to $0^\circ$, $360^\circ$, $720^\circ$, $1080^\circ$ (or negative equivalents, such as $-360\circ$, $-720^\circ$, $-1080^\circ$, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find the coterminal angle, either add or subtract $360x^\circ$ from an angle (both work so long as $x$ is a whole number)</li>
<li>$x$ here can be any whole number, so you can use $x=1$ ($360^\circ$), $x = 2$ ($720^\circ$)
<ul>
<li>E.g. Let's try to find the coterminal angles of $-520^\circ$</li>
<li>To find a positive coterminal angle $\theta_+$, then $\theta_+ = (-520^\circ) + 360^\circ x$</li>
<li>To get a multiple of $360^\circ$ that will make the final coterminal angle positive, we need to set $x \geq 2$</li>
<li>If we set $x = 2$, we get a result of $200^\circ$, which is our <strong>positive coterminal angle</strong></li>
<li>Let's also find a negative coterminal angle</li>
<li>To find a negative coterminal angle $\theta_-$, then $\theta_- = (-520^\circ - 360^\circ x$)</li>
<li>Since $-520^\circ$ is already negative, let's just set $x = 1$</li>
<li>If we set $x = 1$, we get a result of $-880^\circ$, which is our <strong>negative coterminal angle</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complementary and Supplementary Angles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complementary angles</strong> are two angles that add up to 90 degrees</li>
<li>A complementary angle <em>must</em> be positive
<ul>
<li>This is why no angle above $90^\circ$ has a complement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Supplementary angles</strong> are two angles that add up to 180 degrees</li>
<li>A supplementary angle <em>must</em> also be positive
<ul>
<li>This is why no angle above $180^\circ$ has a complement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decimal Degrees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Historically, fractional parts of degrees were expressed in <em>minutes</em> and <em>seconds</em>, e.g. $\theta = 64^\circ\ 32'\ 47''$ instead of decimal degrees (e.g. $\theta = 64.2345^\circ$) - this is called the <strong>DMS system</strong>
<ul>
<li>One minute, represented with the prime (`) symbol, is defined as $\left(\frac{1}{60} \cdot 1^\circ\right)$</li>
<li>One second, represented with the double prime (``) symbol, is defined as $\left(\frac{1}{3600} \cdot 1^\circ\right)$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To convert from DMS to degrees we use:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\mathrm{Degrees} = \mathrm{DMS\ Degrees} + \frac{\mathrm{DMS\ Minutes}}{60} + \frac{\mathrm{DMS\ Seconds}}{3600}
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>To convert from degrees to DMS we use:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\mathrm{DMS\ Degrees} = \mathrm{Degrees} + \frac{\mathrm{Decimal\ part\ of\ degrees}}{60} + \frac{\mathrm{Decimal\ part\ of\ (decimal \ part\ of\ degrees)}}{60}
$$</p>
<h2>Radians</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/2332/2018/01/11202419/CNX_Calc_Figure_01_03_001.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Take a look at this special circle. What do you notice?</p>
<p>Well, firstly, the radius is 1. So we call the circle a <strong>unit circle</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, the radius is actually part of a very special arc. We know that the radius is equal to one, which means the circle's circumference is $\pi (2 \cdot 1)$ which  is $2\pi$. Meanwhile, the arc length ($s$), radius (1), and central angle ($\theta$) are related like this:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = \frac{s}{r}
$$</p>
<p>In our case, since $r = 1$, we simplify to:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = s
$$</p>
<p>Wow! So the arc length is <em>also</em> the measure of the angle? How could this be possible?</p>
<p>It makes more sense if we start thinking of angles as units of $\pi$.  Let's imagine that the central angle $\theta = 180^\circ$.  If that was the case, the arc would be a semicircle, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mathopenref.com/images/circles/semicircle.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>And since the arc length $s$ of a semicircle is exactly half of the circumference of a full circle, we can say that:</p>
<p>$$
s = \frac{1}{2}C = \frac{1}{2}\pi 2r = \pi r
$$</p>
<p>Based on our formula $\theta = s$ (because our radius is 1), we can also find that:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = s = \pi r
$$</p>
<p>And again, since we know that $r = 1$, this simplifies to:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = (\pi \cdot 1) = \pi
$$</p>
<p>So we find that $\theta$ is equal to $\pi$ degrees. We now have a new unit to measure angles: the <strong>radian</strong>. </p>
<p>We also know that a <strong>radian</strong> can be roughly defined as degrees expressed in units of $\pi$ rather than decimal units. $2 \pi$ radians is a full 360 degrees, $\pi$ radians is 180 degrees, and we can keep dividing so on. Instead of counting from 0 to 360 degrees, in radians, we count from 0 to $2\pi$. And since $\pi$ radians is equal to $180^\circ$, 1 radian is also equal to $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$ which resolves to approximately $57.3^\circ$.</p>
<h3>Rules of radians</h3>
<p>Radians are a <strong>unit of measurement</strong> for angles. We can express angles in:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\pi$ form, where we state radians in terms of $\pi$ (e.g. $2\pi \mathrm{\ rad.} = 360^\circ$)</li>
<li>Exact form, where we state radians in terms of decimal units (e.g. $1.3\mathrm{\ rad.}$)</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
1 \mathrm{\ radian} = 1^\circ \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
$$</p>
<p>$$
1^\circ = 1 \mathrm{\ radian} \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
$$</p>
<p>$$
\pi \mathrm{\ rad.} = 180^\circ
$$</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Radians ($\pi$)</th><th>Radians (exact)</th><th>Degrees</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>0 radians</td><td>0.0 radians</td><td>0 degrees</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians</td><td>~1.57 radians</td><td>90 degrees</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\pi$ radians</td><td>~3.14 radians</td><td>180 degrees</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\frac{3\pi}{2}$ radians</td><td>~4.7 radians</td><td>270 degrees</td></tr>
<tr><td>$2\pi$ radians</td><td>~6.28 radians</td><td>360 degrees</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Counting in Radians</h3>
<p>Imagine you were given an angle $\theta = \frac{9\pi}{4}\mathrm{\ rad.}$ How would you be able to draw it?</p>
<p>Well, we know that $\frac{9\pi}{4}$ is just $\frac{\pi}{4}$ repeated 9 times. And $\frac{\pi}{4}$ is just a 45 degree angle. So let's try counting in 45 degrees around the graph:</p>
<p>(Add gif of counting in 45 degrees 9 times to get to the final position)</p>
<h3>Drawing radians in Standard Position</h3>
<p>We can use the rules of radians and coterminal angles to help us draw radians.</p>
<p>For instance, let's try to draw $\theta = \frac{5\pi}{2}$. We know that $\frac{5\pi}{2}$ is equal to $\frac{4\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2}$, so:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = 2\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}
$$</p>
<p>So, we'll need to rotate 360 degrees once (because $2\pi$ is one full revolution), and then we need to rotate by 1/4 of a revolution (because $\frac{\pi}{2}$ is 90 degrees)</p>
<p>Now for a harder example. Let's try to draw 4 radians on the graph.</p>
<h3>Finding coterminal angles for radians</h3>
<p>Add 2 pi, minus 2 pi...</p>
<h3>Arc length</h3>
<p>If we're using degrees, the arc length $s$ is given by:</p>
<p>$$
s = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 2 \pi r
$$</p>
<p>If we're using radians, the arc length is given by:</p>
<p>$$
s = r \theta
$$</p>
<p>where $\theta$ is in radians.</p>
<h3>Linear and angular speeds</h3>
<p><strong>Linear speed</strong> is distance travelled over time elapsed. We measure it in units of <em>distance</em> per <em>time interval</em> (e.g. meters per second)</p>
<p>Linear speed is given by:</p>
<p>$$
v = \frac{\mathrm{arc\ length}}{\mathrm{time}} = \frac{s}{t}
$$</p>
<p>A <strong>revolution</strong> is the fraction of a circumference travelled over time elapsed. We often abbreviate this as RPM (revolutions per minute) or RPS (revolutions per second). To get from linear speed to revolutions, we use:</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{revolutions} = \frac{v}{\mathrm{circumference}}
$$</p>
<p><strong>Angular speed</strong> is the angle displaced over time elapsed. We measure it in units of <em>angles</em> per <em>time interval</em> (e.g. degrees per second)</p>
<p>Angular speed in degrees is given by:</p>
<p>$$
\omega = \frac{v}{\mathrm{circumference}} \cdot 360^\circ = \mathrm{revolutions} \cdot360^\circ
$$</p>
<p>Similarly, angular speed in radians (e.g. radians per second) is given by:</p>
<p>$$
\omega = \frac{v}{\mathrm{circumference}} \cdot 2 \pi \mathrm{\ rad.} = \mathrm{revolutions} \cdot 2\pi \mathrm{\ rad.}
$$</p>
<h2>The Six Trigonometric Functions</h2>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>$$
\sin \theta = \frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{adjacent}}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\tan \theta = \frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
$$</p>
<p>The <em>reciprocal trigonometric functions</em> are the normal trig functions but &quot;flipped over&quot;, and they look like this:</p>
<p>$$
\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan}
$$</p>
<h3>Special Right Triangles</h3>
<p>In the 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio $a: a\sqrt{2}:a$, where two sides are congruent, and the hypotenuse is $a \sqrt{2}$:</p>

<p>In the 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio $a:2a:a\sqrt{3}$, where $a$ is the shortest side, and the hypotenuse is $2a$:</p>
<img src="https://useruploads.socratic.org/DXZSGzPASGC3lfbzCHRK_2000px-30-60-90_triangle.svg.png" width=250 />
<h3>Trigonometric Identities</h3>
<p>We already know that $\csc$, $\sec$, and $\cot$ are reciprocals of the three base trigonometric functions, $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\tan$. Additionally, there are several others that are helpful to know:</p>
<p>$$
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}
$$</p>
<p>Based on the pythagorean theorem, we can find a few others:</p>
<p>$$
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
$$</p>
<p>$$
1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta
$$</p>
<p>$$
1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta
$$</p>
<p>Here, $\sin^2 \theta$ is equal to $(\sin \theta)^2$.</p>
<p>If you forget these, it's okay! You can manually derive all of them from the <strong>unit circle</strong>, which we'll explore next.</p>
<h2>The Unit Circle</h2>
<p>Imagine a circle with a radius of exactly one radius. It would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/DevelopmentalMath/TEXTGROUP-15-19_RESOURCE/U19_L1_T3_text_final_3_files/image019.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Why would this be helpful, you ask? Well, a unit circle helps us to find the exact values of the trigonometric functions.</p>
<p>Take a look at the right triangle inscribed within the unit circle:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/DevelopmentalMath/TEXTGROUP-15-19_RESOURCE/U19_L1_T3_text_final_3_files/image022.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>That's interesting, isn't it? If the angle is 30 degrees, then we know that $x$, $y$, and the radius form a 30-60-90 triangle. From there, we can calculate the values for all 6 trigonometric functions, from the sides of the triangle. And, we know that the point $\frac{\pi}{6}$ on the unit circle's circumference must therefore equal $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$.</p>
<p>What if the angle is 45 degrees? Same deal, just with a 45-45-90 triangle:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/DevelopmentalMath/TEXTGROUP-15-19_RESOURCE/U19_L1_T3_text_final_3_files/image036.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>So we know that the point $\frac{\pi}{4}$ must equal $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.</p>
<p>And we can do more, because we can use the same method to find the positions of points in other quadrants, too. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/DevelopmentalMath/TEXTGROUP-15-19_RESOURCE/U19_L1_T3_text_final_3_files/image118.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here, we've found that the point $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$ is equal to $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$. In fact, we can just remember a simple rule to &quot;translate&quot; the trig function measures from one quadrants to all the other ones:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/DevelopmentalMath/TEXTGROUP-15-19_RESOURCE/U19_L1_T3_text_final_3_files/image173.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Quadrant</th><th>Sign</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Quadrant I</td><td><strong>A</strong>ll are positive</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quadrant II</td><td><strong>S</strong>ine is positive, rest are negative</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quadrant III</td><td><strong>T</strong>angent is positive, rest are negative</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quadrant IV</td><td><strong>C</strong>osine is positive, rest are negative</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Finally, for whoever just wants to have a good quick reference, this is a fully labelled unit circle:</p>
<p><img src="https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/43200/43215/unit-circle7_43215_lg.gif" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Reference angles</h3>
<p>For any angle $\dfrac{k\pi}{3}$, the reference angle is $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$ or $60^\circ$.</p>
<p>For any angle $\dfrac{k\pi}{4}$, the reference angle is $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ or $45^\circ$.</p>
<p>For any angle $\dfrac{k\pi}{6}$, the reference angle is $\dfrac{\pi}{6}$ or $30^\circ$.</p>
<h3>Finding the trigonometric functions from a point on the unit circle</h3>
<p>Let's say you were given a point $t = -\frac{5\pi}{4}$. How can we find the 6 trig functions from it?</p>
<p>Well, the first part we know is that $-\frac{5\pi}{4} = -225^\circ$, which means that it will land in Quadrant 2. So, the $x$ coordinate will be negative, and the $y$ coordinate will be positive.</p>
<p>We also know that the reference angle is $\frac{\pi}{4}$, from which we can draw a 45-45-90 triangle like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/circle-inscribed-triangle.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now we can use our special right triangle to find that:</p>
<p>$$
\sin \left(-\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) =  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\cos \left(-\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\tan \left(-\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = -1
$$</p>
<p>There we go!</p>
<p>Another example know - what if the point $t = 2\pi$?</p>
<p>sine is y, cos is x, tan is sine/cosine</p>
<h2>The trig song</h2>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;One, Two, Three&quot; is the first row of the table</p>
<p>&quot;Three, Two, One&quot; is the second row</p>
<p>&quot;Two under the bar&quot; means to make 2 the denominator of every number (so 1 will become $\frac{1}{2}$, 2 will become $\frac{2}{2}$, you get the idea)</p>
<p>&quot;Square root all that's not one&quot; means to add a square root to every number (in rows 1) and 2) that, as you might have guessed, is <strong>not 1</strong>)</p>
<p>&quot;Square root of three over three&quot; is for the first column of the third row ($\tan 30^\circ$)</p>
<p>&quot;One, then square root of three&quot; is for the second and third columns of the third row ($\tan 45^\circ$ and $\tan 60^\circ$)</p>
