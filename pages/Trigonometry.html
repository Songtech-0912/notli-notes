        <h1>Trigonometry</h1>
<h2>Angles and Measures</h2>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>angle</strong> is the space between two rays that share a common endpoint</li>
<li>The point where the two rays of an angle meet is called the <strong>vertex</strong></li>
<li>The starting side of an angle is its <strong>initial side</strong>, and the ending side of an angle is its <strong>terminal side</strong></li>
<li>Positive angles go counterclockwise from the initial side, negative angles go clockwise from the initial side</li>
<li>An angle is in <strong>standard position</strong> if its vertex is located at the origin and one ray is on the positive x-axis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Coterminal Angles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coterminal angles</strong> start from standard position and share the same terminal side</li>
<li>Two angles that are coterminal satisfy $\angle \beta = \angle \alpha \pm 360^\circ x$
<ul>
<li>E.g. they can add up to $0^\circ$, $360^\circ$, $720^\circ$, $1080^\circ$ (or negative equivalents, such as $-360\circ$, $-720^\circ$, $-1080^\circ$, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find the coterminal angle, either add or subtract $360x^\circ$ from an angle (both work so long as $x$ is a whole number)</li>
<li>$x$ here can be any whole number, so you can use $x=1$ ($360^\circ$), $x = 2$ ($720^\circ$)
<ul>
<li>E.g. Let's try to find the coterminal angles of $-520^\circ$</li>
<li>To find a positive coterminal angle $\theta_+$, then $\theta_+ = (-520^\circ) + 360^\circ x$</li>
<li>To get a multiple of $360^\circ$ that will make the final coterminal angle positive, we need to set $x \geq 2$</li>
<li>If we set $x = 2$, we get a result of $200^\circ$, which is our <strong>positive coterminal angle</strong></li>
<li>Let's also find a negative coterminal angle</li>
<li>To find a negative coterminal angle $\theta_-$, then $\theta_- = (-520^\circ - 360^\circ x$)</li>
<li>Since $-520^\circ$ is already negative, let's just set $x = 1$</li>
<li>If we set $x = 1$, we get a result of $-880^\circ$, which is our <strong>negative coterminal angle</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complementary and Supplementary Angles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complementary angles</strong> are two angles that add up to 90 degrees</li>
<li>A complementary angle <em>must</em> be positive
<ul>
<li>This is why no angle above $90^\circ$ has a complement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Supplementary angles</strong> are two angles that add up to 180 degrees</li>
<li>A supplementary angle <em>must</em> also be positive
<ul>
<li>This is why no angle above $180^\circ$ has a complement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decimal Degrees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Historically, fractional parts of degrees were expressed in <em>minutes</em> and <em>seconds</em>, e.g. $\theta = 64^\circ\ 32'\ 47''$ instead of decimal degrees (e.g. $\theta = 64.2345^\circ$) - this is called the <strong>DMS system</strong>
<ul>
<li>One minute, represented with the prime (`) symbol, is defined as $\left(\frac{1}{60} \cdot 1^\circ\right)$</li>
<li>One second, represented with the double prime (``) symbol, is defined as $\left(\frac{1}{3600} \cdot 1^\circ\right)$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To convert from DMS to degrees we use:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\mathrm{Degrees} = \mathrm{DMS\ Degrees} + \frac{\mathrm{DMS\ Minutes}}{60} + \frac{\mathrm{DMS\ Seconds}}{3600}
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>To convert from degrees to DMS we use:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\mathrm{DMS\ Degrees} = \mathrm{Degrees} + \frac{\mathrm{Decimal\ part\ of\ degrees}}{60} + \frac{\mathrm{Decimal\ part\ of\ (decimal \ part\ of\ degrees)}}{60}
$$</p>
<h2>Radians</h2>

<p>Take a look at this special circle. What do you notice?</p>
<p>Well, firstly, the radius is 1. So we call the circle a <strong>unit circle</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, the radius is actually part of a very special arc. We know that the radius is equal to one, which means the circle's circumference is $\pi (2 \cdot 1)$ which  is $2\pi$. Meanwhile, the arc length ($s$), radius (1), and central angle ($\theta$) are related like this:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = \frac{s}{r}
$$</p>
<p>In our case, since $r = 1$, we simplify to:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = s
$$</p>
<p>Wow! So the arc length is <em>also</em> the measure of the angle? How could this be possible?</p>
<p>It makes more sense if we start thinking of angles as units of $\pi$.  Let's imagine that the central angle $\theta = 180^\circ$.  If that was the case, the arc would be a semicircle, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mathopenref.com/images/circles/semicircle.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>And since the arc length $s$ of a semicircle is exactly half of the circumference of a full circle, we can say that:</p>
<p>$$
s = \frac{1}{2}C = \frac{1}{2}\pi 2r = \pi r
$$</p>
<p>Based on our formula $\theta = s$ (because our radius is 1), we can also find that:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = s = \pi r
$$</p>
<p>And again, since we know that $r = 1$, this simplifies to:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = (\pi \cdot 1) = \pi
$$</p>
<p>So we find that $\theta$ is equal to $\pi$ degrees. We now have a new unit to measure degrees: the <strong>radian</strong>. </p>
<p>So a <strong>radian</strong> can be roughly defined as degrees expressed in units of $\pi$ rather than decimal units. $2 \pi$ radians is a full 360 degrees, $\pi$ radians is 180 degrees, and we can keep dividing so on. Instead of counting from 0 to 360 degrees, in radians, we count from 0 to $2\pi$. And since $\pi$ radians is equal to $180^\circ$, 1 radian is also equal to $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$ which resolves to approximately $57.3^\circ$.</p>
<h3>Rules of radians</h3>
<p>$$
1 \mathrm{\ radian} = 1^\circ \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
$$</p>
<p>$$
1^\circ = 1 \mathrm{\ radian} \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
$$</p>
