        <h1>The Great Gatsby Notes</h1>
<p>Jacky Song</p>
<h2>Notes on this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li>The page numbers are <em>approximate</em> and can vary hugely based on the edition you're using</li>
<li>These notes were taken over several months and I make no guarantees about their quality</li>
<li>The quotes in the observation sections are typically condensed, because they're actually a page long, but I use <code>...</code> to indicate the rest of the quote</li>
</ul>
<h2>Big Picture</h2>
<ul>
<li>The novel is a romanticized (not true to life) depiction of the Jazz Age
<ul>
<li>Each character and aspect ofthe novel is an exaggerated version of a real-life persona</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick plays a central role in how the story is told</li>
<li>Daisy is never described directly
<ul>
<li>You never know what she looks like!</li>
<li>Instead she is always indirectly visualized by drawing comparisons with other characters</li>
<li>We only hear descriptions of her voice, which is supposed to be magical - but what does that mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Background
<ul>
<li>Prohibition was an attempt to purge society of the evils of alcohol - in its place, it gave society the first modern form of organized crime</li>
<li>The country is about to go into the Great Depression by the late 1920s yet no one is realizing it</li>
<li>Years of deregulation and lack of attention was the precursor for a crash</li>
<li>The story is created by its times</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A book about obsession romanticized as love</li>
<li>New Money vs. Old Money
<ul>
<li>The people with new money live on the West Egg, and the people with old money live on the East Egg</li>
<li>Both frown on each others' ways</li>
<li>And yet each have similar respective faults</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fake identity
<ul>
<li>Things which appear to be wonderful often end up lacking substance after close examination</li>
<li>A seemingly booming economy was actually a time coming to an end</li>
<li>Wealth is not candid and seems &quot;fake&quot; - everyone in the book is doing something wrong</li>
<li>Material possessions become someone's identity</li>
<li>Jay Gatsby's name is <strong>not even</strong> his name!</li>
<li>Nick's storytelling is fake and unreliable
<ul>
<li>Nick starts the book talking about how great his morals are - <em>&quot;I'm inclined to reserve all judgements&quot;</em> in order to make him likeable to the reader
<ul>
<li>Nick seems to be humble and self-aware by acknowledging his priviledges <em>but he wants to make sure you know what his privileges are!</em>
<ul>
<li>It's a really good way to make you think of Nick as a good person</li>
<li>Nick's way of writing makes us like him and relate to him</li>
<li>He's an expert at trying to make himself look good and hide the things that makes him look bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But Nick still holds himself above others in the way he makes judgements and conducts his life</li>
<li>He sounds like a good guy but is anything but - saying this is a way to elevate himself</li>
<li>It's actually just a way to excuse his actual morally questionably actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are fooled by Nick's charms until you realize what he does</li>
<li>The story is told several years after it happened</li>
<li>He is telling this story to make himself look good</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The novel is not about actual good people, it's about people who are obssessed with having the <em>appearance</em> of being good people (whilst in actuality being anything but good)</li>
<li>The novel narrates the thoughts and feelings of its characters</li>
<li>The nature of a <strong>novel</strong> as a &quot;novel&quot; (new) form of writing is that its construction is defined by the <strong>narrator</strong>
<ul>
<li>A pioneering achievement of the novel is that it creates a narrator whose <em>perspective</em> and identity is key in understanding the story</li>
<li>The narrative frame is an invention used to allow first-person narrators to tell the story</li>
<li>Understanding the nature of the narrator is critical to how the story is told</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>novelty</strong> of new technology (automobiles) can catapult our actions, whether in a good or bad way
<ul>
<li>It can accelerate the rate at which something gets done - but it also allows us to be more capable of doing damage than ever before </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carelessness
<ul>
<li>&quot;Let other people be careful - they will make sure I'll be okay&quot; - to count on others to keep you safe wouldn't work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fragility of the American Dream
<ul>
<li>The ideal is that we as individuals can achieve anything through hard work</li>
<li>But there is a fragility to the American Dream, because the appearance of success on the surface may well be an artifical creation</li>
<li>&quot;Gatsby&quot; is Gatsby's facade of himself, because &quot;Gatsby&quot; isn't even his real name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fitzgerald references medieval motifs and ideas (e.g. the green light as a symbol of hope) to critique and attack society, by showing how societal norms of thinking is closely correlated with sheltered medieval thinking (that people add in imaginary things to serve their self-interest), and lead to social decline and fallout.
<ul>
<li>More simply, the &quot;made-up&quot; ideas of society are medieval thinking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What does it mean for a dream to come true?</li>
<li>What happens if you idealize something until you lose track of reality?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of main character, Nick Carraway

</ul>
</li>

<li>Nick, a midwesterner, is also is an alumni of Yale University and a soldier serving during WWI
<ul>

<li>Gatsby hosts extravagant and riotous parties on his estate but he himself never parties</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 1 (Pg. 1)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since...and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nick says <em>&quot;I'm inclined to reserve all judgements&quot;</em> but this is more revealing than appears on first glance
<ul>
<li>It means that he <em>does</em> have judgements, but he only keeps his judgements to himself, and chooses not to disclose them to others
<ul>
<li>As we find out soon, he has a <strong>lot</strong> of judgements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He also explains that he was <em>&quot;unjustly accused&quot;</em> of being a politician during his time in college
<ul>
<li>He portrays himself as a victim of other people's secrets</li>
<li>And he is mistrusted by others because he puts on a facade to appease everyone, which ends up pleasing no one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He claims that the most personal thoughts of young men are often <em>&quot;marred by obvious suppressions&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>We get hints that he takes advantage of other people and likes to frame the story, not only to make him seem like the &quot;victim&quot;, but to villify the actual victim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick also says that <em>&quot;reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>On the surface it means that Nick's attitude towards being nonjudgemental is to &quot;hope&quot; that by doing nothing, the big problems in the secret lives of the people he meets would sort themselves out
<ul>
<li>However, this is clearly a vain and unrealistic hope - a central motif that is repeated throughout the story, just like Gatsby's unrealistic hope of reconciling with Daisy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We remember that Nick said that he <em>&quot;reserves judgements&quot;</em> but he makes numerous judgements throughout the same page as this quote</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 2 (Pg. 2)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever...floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short- winded elations of men.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nick interestingly calls Gatsby <em>&quot;The <strong>Great</strong> Gatsby&quot;</em>, and the unusual title corresponds with Nick's unusual view of Gatsby</li>
<li>For Nick, Gatsby is approached with a mixture of fascination and disgust - <em>&quot;...everything for which I had an unaffected scorn&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick is covetous of what Gatsby has</li>
<li>He alternates between praising and damning Gatsby in a contradictory fashion
<ul>
<li>Thus, it makes his true feelings ambiguous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The antecedent is that there is &quot;something <em>gorgeous</em> about him&quot;, otherwise Nick would not be calling him &quot;The 'Great' Gatsby&quot;
<ul>
<li>2 qualities:
<ul>
<li>A <em>&quot;romantic readiness&quot;</em> - a personality ready for emotion and romance</li>
<li>An <em>&quot;extraordinary gift for hope</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On one hand, Gatsby is described as an emotionally and romantically-ready person, but on the other, this is only <em>Nick's view</em> of Gatsby, not Gatsby's own view of himself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;It is what preyed on Gatsby...that temporarily closed out my interest...&quot;</em> - Nick is specifically omitting details of a painful past in order to excuse Gatsby</li>
<li><em>&quot;If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, <strong>then</strong> there was something gorgeous about him&quot;</em> - using the term &quot;personality&quot; is odd when the term &quot;character&quot; would be more appropriate <em>at first glance</em>, but upon closer inspection you realize why:
<ul>
<li>It implies that personality is a <em>created</em> illusion made from our appearances and behavior (&quot;gestures&quot;) as opposed to our character</li>
<li>Shows that personality is a very superficial view of a person and rarely gives a true impression of who they truly are</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 3 (Pg. 10-11)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;‘You are!’ He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. ‘How you ever get anything done is beyond me.’
I looked at Miss Baker wondering...it occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;I <strong>enjoyed</strong> looking at her&quot;</em> distant and mechanical way of communicating Nick's interest
<ul>
<li>Nick describes her in purely superficial terms <em>&quot;with an erect carriage&quot;</em></li>
<li>Nick specifically describes her &quot;like a young cadet&quot; - he unusually fixates on several parts of her body with a very limited amount of interest
<ul>
<li>He also describes Jordan in terms of a young male soldier which is odd at best</li>
<li>In fact Nick's ability to describe all women in general is distant, lacking, and with an emphasized male gaze</li>
<li>Showing Nick is a very limited, self-serving person who has a limited capacity for romance or being with women, even though he comes off as a nice person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately it shows that Nick's relationship with Jordan is incredibly bloodless and non-romantic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 4 (Pg. 20-21)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light...I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The end of the chapter is incredibly descriptive - <em>&quot;The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life.&quot;</em></li>
<li>Gatsby decides to spend the night alone for the while</li>
<li>Nick wishes to call to him and shows a continued interest in him
<ul>
<li>Nick views Gatsby as almost an idol and mystifies him</li>
<li>So Nick doesn't disturb him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby might be keeping to himself because he does not belong in the company of the members of the wealthy, upper-class guests that party at his estate</li>
<li><em>&quot;I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light&quot;</em> - green light is a symbol of Daisy, Gatsby's love interest, and green is the color of hope
<ul>
<li>Gatsby is reaching his arms out for Daisy - <em>&quot;he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling&quot;</em></li>
<li>Nobody in real life does that!</li>
<li>It's ridiculous - a description of something that is highly romanticized but entirely unrealistic
<ul>
<li>Nick describes things that sound wonderful but seem over-heightened and don't <em>feel</em> right (unauthentic) and doesn't happen in real life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last line - Gatsby <em>&quot;disappears&quot;</em> showing him to be a man of mystery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>As Nick and Tom are riding the train from the West Egg to New York Tom takes Nick out at one of the stops</li>
<li>Tom leads Nick to George Wilson's garage which overlooks a desolate plain
<ul>
<li>Tom is cheating on Daisy, his actual wife</li>
<li>Tom's mistress Myrtle is Wilson's wife</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tom takes Nick and Myrtle to New York City to his Morningside Heights apartment
<ul>
<li>They have a party with Myrtle's sister Catherine and the McKees</li>
<li>The group drinks excessively and wildly gossips</li>
<li>The ostenatious behavior and conversation at the party repulse Nick yet he is also fascinated by the lurid spectacle of the same extravagance
<ul>
<li>Myrtle begins to mention Daisy, Tom's wife</li>
<li>Tom retaliates violently (punches Myrtle), which abruptly ends the party, and Nick leaves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 5 (Pg. 23-24)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain...valley of ashes...There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Startling description the valley of ashes - theme of desolation
<ul>
<li>The description of <em>&quot;bounded on one side by a small foul river&quot;</em> draws an allusion to the River Styx flowing through Hades
<ul>
<li>A contrast created between the opulence of the world we just saw and the wasteland we now see</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The faded image of the billboard of Dr. Eckleburg - 2 eyes, glasses, no nose left
<ul>
<li>The face is so incomplete that it's just eyes, showing the area is so badly damaged that it's beyond repair</li>
<li>The image of the big blue eyes being the only objects left, is symbolic of the shallow morals of the remaining characters, whose outward appearances are all that are left of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fitzgerald shows that whatever the hopeful sentiments of East and West Egg, there is still a &quot;forgotten land&quot; in between and there isn't much hope at all</li>
<li>Myrtle's husband is portrayed as a very &quot;small&quot; man trying to hold on to life</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 6 (Pg. 35)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present...Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves...I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nick's tone in describing other characters is often very revealing and gives us hidden insight
<ul>
<li>Nick's very out of place the entire chapter - watching things and never participating in them</li>
<li>Everything is foreign - Nick is stuck in his own thoughts and behaves abnormally</li>
<li>Nick is <em>so</em> not in the moment (always developing a perspective) that he</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;[The] celebrated sandwiches...[are] a complete supper in themselves&quot;</em> - Nick didn't enjoy anything other than the sandwiches, even though they were having fine dining at the party
<ul>
<li>Oxymoron of being <em>&quot;simultaneously enchanted and repelled&quot;</em> by that lifestyle</li>
<li>Contradiction of Nick, a person who is constantly offering perspective, to not be able to stick to one perspective - he is enchanted some times, and repelled at some other time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the gathering there is a lot of alcohol
<ul>
<li>Tom hits Myrtle because he feels secure and safe being of high class and station</li>
<li>Nick should be the one who intervenes <em>but</em> he doesn't!</li>
<li>He doesn't even react at all because he is so remote and distant:
<ul>
<li>It is narrated with the same blank tone as everything else</li>
<li>Even though Myrtle's nose is hit and bleeding, Nick describes everything <em>but</em> the nose! He completely ignores the nose!</li>
<li>The next paragraph doesn't focus it at all - he's transitioned away from what happened and to another subject</li>
<li>Shows that Nick doesn't simply reserve judgement - he is actively avoiding any chance to do anything - he'll rather narrate something else then narrate the actual problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shows that despite Tom's stature and sophistication he is still capable of savage violence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby's chauffeur brings Nick an invitation to one of Gatsby's weekend parties</li>
<li>Nick goes to the party with Jordan</li>
<li>Guests at the party exchange rumors about Gastby - no one knows the truth about his wealth or even who he is</li>
<li>At midnight, Nick sits at a table with a young man - he introduces himself as Gatsby
<ul>
<li>Nick realizes that Gasby was in the same division as his during the Great War (WWI)</li>
<li>He notices Gatsby does not drink and he keeps himself separate from the party's opulence</li>
<li>Gatsby calls Jordan away to have a secret conversation with her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The party continues into the night</li>
<li>On his way home from the party, Nick sees an old man (&quot;Owl Eyes&quot;), who stays in the library to avoid getting more drunk</li>
<li>Nick then narrates about his personal day-to-day life in the city
<ul>
<li>He has begun seeing Jordan</li>
<li>While he knows that Jordan is fundamentally a dishonest person (she cheated in her first golf tournament), he feels attracted to her in spite of it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 7 (Pg. 39-40)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars...Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves...[they] glide on through the sea change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nick knows almost everything about Gatsby's routine and schedule
<ul>
<li>Yet Nick chooses to use egranidzing language to heighten the sense of extravagance and opulence for Gatsby</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a contradiction between the constant activity and the huge cost of even one party, begging us to question Gatsby's seemingly infinite wealth
<ul>
<li>Nick is both amazed and yet repelled by the materialism of all this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;Men and girls came and went like moths&quot;</em> - moths flock to wherever thelight is and go away whenever the light is gone, a starkingly accurate metaphor for Gatsby's guests themselves</li>
<li>After each party, there are a lot of staff &quot;repairing&quot; the premises from <em>&quot;the ravages of the night before&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>The party is wild and riotous - the people who go to the parties are aimless, have no knowledge of Gatsby, and leave nothing behind but destruction</li>
<li>The event itself is superficial and pointless - even though the partygoers often go there multiple times, they immediately forget each others names</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For Gatsby, the party's entire purpose is to attract Daisy's attention in the hope that one day she will come and reunite with Gatsby
<ul>
<li>A very romantic but not at all realistic approach
<ul>
<li>Gatsby knows it is neither sensible nor practical yet he does it anyway</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allegory of the 20s being a time of indulgence, wastefulness, and emptiness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;Laughter is...spilled with prodigality&quot;</em> - &quot;prodigality&quot; means wastefulness
<ul>
<li>But notice, while Nick says he reserves judgements, here he is making a judgement!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 8 (Pg. 45-46)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of  books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot. 
‘What do you think?’ he demanded impetuously.
‘About what?’
He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.
‘About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.’
‘ The books?’
He nodded.
‘Absolutely real—have pages and everything.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the meeting with the old man, the old man tries to go to the library to sober up - but it's pointless and doesn't make any sense!</li>
<li>The books are old yet real
<ul>
<li>The old man's surprise that the books are real indicate his assumption that they were fakes</li>
<li>He finds it odd that they are authentic even though everything else about the party is just here to impress</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;He...didn't cut the pages&quot;</em> - in the past, bound books needed to be hand-cut by the first person who read them, and if a book is never cut, that means it was never <em>read</em>
<ul>
<li>Even though the books are real, their <em>real</em> purpose is still only for show</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;I've been drunk for a week&quot;</em> - emblematic of the people and mentality of the 20s</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 9 (Pg. 43-44)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;‘I like to come,’ Lucille said. ‘I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.’
‘Did you keep it?’ asked Jordan.
‘Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.’
‘There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,’ said the other girl eagerly. ‘He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.’
‘Who doesn’t?’ I inquired.
‘Gatsby. Somebody told me——‘
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially. ‘Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.’ A thrill passed over all of us....We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;There's something funny about [the] fellow...he doesn't want any trouble with anybody&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby frequently uses &quot;hush money&quot; to solve his issues, which is normally associated with criminal practice, not wealthy young men like him</li>
<li>The fact that money is his only protection alludes to the fact that he doesn't have any real allies to support him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;...from those who found little that it wasnecessary to whisperabout in this world&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>People had a tendency to glarmorize Gatsby because they had so little going on in their lives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;A thrill passed over us&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>We love to hear the &quot;dark sides&quot; of the rich and famous, both to be disgusted but also amazed</li>
<li>There is an alluring quality to speculate on celebrities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 10 (Pg. 47-49)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound. 
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled...
He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor...Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nick's choice of words in describing Gatsby before their first meeting and after their first meeting is starkingly different</li>
<li>Gatsby assumes a strange familiarity when talking to Nick
<ul>
<li>He uses the term &quot;old sport&quot; repeatedly with Nick, which is an archaic term of endearment
<ul>
<li>It's Gatsby's signature phrase and part of the facade of being Gatsby</li>
<li>It sounds like something special but it's not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby tries to make Nick to feel as welcome as possible and does everything to make people comfortable
<ul>
<li>It's unsettling that he can't risk getting people upset (like the replacement dress he bought for the girl earlier)
<ul>
<li>Gatsby doesn't want any trouble with anyone, hinting at his mysterious and shady past</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is something insincere about Gatsby's recollection that he served with Nick
<ul>
<li>It's unlikely that Gatsby would remember Nick and Nick would not remember Gatsby</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby's introduction to Nick is awkward and abrupt
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it..&quot;</em> The description of the smile of Gatsby is warm and comforting, yet eery, hypnotic and almost seductive.
<ul>
<li>This is an <em>impossible</em> smile and could never occur in real life</li>
<li>The smile only exists in Nick's imagination - it is <strong>contrived</strong> by a writer</li>
<li><em>&quot;It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>The smile seems to say that the two of them will be friends with each other, yet not be completely honest with each other, and not try to understand each other beyond whatever is convenient
<ul>
<li>So long as they don't press too hard for the truth, they will get along just fine</li>
<li>It's a weird game between two insincere, lying people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The premise of any swindle is that the swindler appears to give you confidence - their apparent belief in you allows you to give them your trust. That is the nature of Gatsby's smile - it is a swindle, not a start of a genuine relationship
<ul>
<li>Nick might talk well, but he is likely not a good friend - he won't warn you when you're making bad choices, he'll be dishonest with you to please you. He might seem nice but he'll take advantage of you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick is a liar because he tells lies of omission - he deliberately conceals the truth
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick describes Gatsby as an &quot;elegant young roughneck&quot; - he was a criminal who puts on a show of elegance and watches very carefully what he says</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4>Quote 11 (Pg. 57-59)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in mid-summer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nick perpetually tries to restrain his emotions in regards to Jordan for unusual reasons.
<ul>
<li>He cannot seem to enter into a truly committed relationship. Everything about a relationship seems oddly self-serving for him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply...&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick chooses to disregard Jordan's dishonesty</li>
<li>Shows Nick has incredible contempt for women because he does not count them morally equal with men</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>“I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.“</em>
<ul>
<li>That is a judgement - it means everyone else around him is more dishonest than him!</li>
<li>Nick is never sincere with women because he has no problem with hustling women</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jordan is unable to be at an disadvantage and uses dishonesty to prevent that
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;...yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body&quot;</em> - a allusion to the fact that Jordan lies to attract men to fulfill her sexual needs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jordan believes she can do whatever she wants and throw responsibility to other people
<ul>
<li>She belives that so long she doesn't meet <em>&quot;another careless driver&quot;</em>, her careless driving won't have any consequences</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nick describes a trip that he took to New York with Gatsby to eat lunch
<ul>
<li>Gatsby tells him about his past, but his story sounds improbable</li>
<li>When Nick asks which Midwestern city he is from, Gatsby replies, “San Francisco”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby’s car speeds through the valley of ashes and enters the city
<ul>
<li>When a policeman pulls Gatsby over for speeding, Gatsby shows him a white card, and the policeman apologizes for bothering him and does nothing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby then proceeds to have lunch with Nick and his friend and business connection (and, it is implied, gangster) Myer Wolfsheim
<ul>
<li>It is clear that the two participated in illegal activities that made them a lot of money</li>
<li>Wolfsheim's got cufflings made of human molars - a sign of violence
<ul>
<li>They are there, not to look good, but to scare and intimidate you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wolfsheim is said to have fixed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_World_Series">1919 World Series</a>, in which he bribed members of the Boston White Sox to underperform</li>
<li>Nick is clearly uncomfortable about he criminal element in Gatsby that he's seeing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the lunch in New York, Nick sees Jordan
<ul>
<li>Jordan finally tells him the details of her scret conversation with Gatsby at the party</li>
<li>Gatsby told her that he is in love with Daisy Buchanan</li>
<li>During the war, before Daisy married Tom, she lived in Louisville, Kentucky, and fell in love with Lieutenant Jay Gatsby, who was stationed at the base near her home</li>
<li>She chose to marry Tom after Gatsby left for the war</li>
<li>But Daisy drank herself into numbness the night before her wedding, after she received a letter from Gatsby</li>
<li>Gatsby, wishing to win back Daisy, bought his mansion in West Egg solely to be near her.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby has asked Jordan to convince Nick to arrange a reunion between Gatsby and Daisy (who is Nick's cousin)
<ul>
<li>Gatsby is terrified that Daisy will refuse to see him, so he wants Nick to invite Daisy to tea, and then Gatsby intends to come over secretly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 12 (Pg. 65-66)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit. 
‘Look here, old sport,’ he broke out surprisingly. ‘What’s your opinion of me, anyhow?’ 
A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves. 
‘Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,’ he interrupted. ‘I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.’ 
So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that favored conversation in his halls. 
‘I’ll tell you God’s truth.’ His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. ‘I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition...’&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby's matter-of-fact expositiong
<ul>
<li>Gastby stresses how his money was gotten from his family</li>
<li>He continues to victimize himself</li>
<li>Contradictory lines:
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west...[in] San Francisco&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Clearly, Gatsby doesn't know that San Francisco is a city on the West Coast</li>
<li>Yet Nick appears to respond nonchalantly with &quot;I know&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;My family all died and I came into a good deal of money&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick almost laughs when Gatsby says he was <em>&quot;...trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby tells us a cherry-picked story</li>
<li>Though Gatsby doesn't tell us, we can infer many things about him:
<ul>
<li>He is clearly lying</li>
<li><em>&quot;My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.&quot;</em></li>
<li>Yet Nick is thrilled the moment when Gatsby appears to vindicate his story with his Montenegran medal and picture from Oxford
<ul>
<li>You can produce a half-truth and produce some elements of truth, and people will believe in it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines. &quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 13 (Pg. 76-77)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I saw them in Santa Barbara...if he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily and say ‘Where’s Tom gone?’ and wear the most abstracted expression...You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;...she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation...perhaps because she doesn’t drink. &quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Being sober around everyone who is drunk - you can do things while they're drunk and get away with it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;Daisy...came out with an absolutely perfect reputation&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick accuses Daisy with being deceptive</li>
<li>It isn't actually true that she has a spotless reputation - she simply carefully times her shadier actions during times when others are drunk so that no one notices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers... &quot;</em>
<ul>
<li><em>amour</em> means 'secret affairs'</li>
<li>Daisy is always &quot;just the voice&quot; without any physical description</li>
<li>The voice betrays her seemingly perfect appearances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;...she’d look around uneasily and say ‘Where’s Tom gone?’&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>She's so painfully aware that Tom is a serial cheater that she is preoccupied with it</li>
<li>This is not lovesickness, this is anxiety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;Tom ran into a wagon...and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him...she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Tom's accident is how the affair was exposed</li>
<li>Cars keep coming up because the new technology is also incredibly destructive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A founding principle of America is that the goal of doing things rightly and correctly and not yielding ourselves to power
<ul>
<li>Nick is surprised that someone could do this</li>

</ul>
<h4>Quote 14 (Pg. 78)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;‘It was a strange coincidence,’ I said. 
‘But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.’ 
‘Why not?’ 
‘Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.’ 
Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor. 
‘He wants to know—’ continued Jordan ‘—if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.’ 
The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could ‘come over’ some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nick is absolutely astounded when he hears of Gatsby’s plan - and he’s seen a lot already</li>
<li>“The modesty of the demand shook me” - Gatsby was willing to do absolutely frivolous things in obsession, and yet rarely asked for a “modest demand”
<ul>
<li>Shows that Gatsby’s preference and taste for grandiose ideas and activities while disregarding practical, day-to-day methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick’s previous impression of Gatsby was one of a “purposeless splendor” - but now Gatsby’s choice astounds Nick, and he “comes alive”</li>
<li>The concept of <strong>obsession</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The exaggerated quality of Daisy's importance to Gatsby signifies his obsession, because his life becomes planned around Daisy.</li>
<li>Everything is filtered through the perception of his obsession</li>
<li>Daisy is the driving influence for Gatsby, and it interferes with how Gatsby makes his decisions</li>
<li>And most of all, Gatsby's obsession is making Daisy an excessive priority that doesn't make sense</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is something ridiculous about Gatsby's entire approach</li>
<li>He cannot go back in time and bring things back to what they were, and he'll never be able to go to the Daisy of 5 years ago because that was 5 years ago!
<ul>
<li>What Gatsby needs is a <strong>time machine</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 15 (Pg. 78)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me...I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There's something lacking in Nick's humanity - he's cold and lifeless and lacks the ability to have a passionate romance</li>
<li>On the face of it, many of the romances of the story sound too good to be true - because none of them are true</li>
<li>Nick isn’t even into the kiss at all - he’s deliberately making it obscure that he’s kissing her</li>
<li>Nick was thinking of “this clean, hard, limited person, who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm” - oxymoronic description, and likely also ironic</li>
<li>Gatsby wishes Daisy not to know - but to be fair his idea of “surprising” her might as well end up shocking her
<ul>
<li>He's really trying to manipulate <em>perception</em> by this way, and hiding his true colors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Her wan, scornful face smiled” - again, an unusual depiction of Jordan as a “scornful smile”</li>
<li>Nick decides to think about Gatsby and Tom on the occasion of his kiss - almost like he's bragging about &quot;having a girl&quot; like Tom and Gatsby</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<li>Gatsby's mansion is lit up brightly despite no one being there</li>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 16 (Pg. 86-88)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note...
‘I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.’
‘You’re acting like a little boy,’ I broke out impatiently. 
‘Not only that but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.’ 
He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes. &quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>This is a very uncomfortable, awkward meeting, the first time we've seen Nick publicly criticize Gatsby</li>
<li>When Daisy comes, Gatsby decides to leave</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick tries to please Gatsby and doesn’t continue to warn him when things are going badly</li>
<li>Gatsby’s childish behavior evinces that he hasn’t matured since 5 years past</li>
<li>Gatsby has never thought about Daisy's perception or wishes during the meeting
<ul>
<li>She has only been an object to Gatsby</li>
<li>He hasn't thought about 'what does she feel?'</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 17 (Pg. 88)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I went in—after...and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby is described as &quot;glowing&quot; and at the highest point in his life</li>
<li>Unluckily, the novel will only go downhill from this point; pleasures do not last</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 18 (Pg. 91-92)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes...
He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the so rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily. 
‘ They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.’&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;He revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes...sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>That is, none of Gatsby's possessions are real because Daisy's here
<ul>
<li>Daisy, who has been just a dream for Gatsby for the past 5 years, has replaced his reality</li>
<li>Gatsby has remade reality for himself, to the point that he is no longer in touch with reality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unusually, Gatsby seems more attached to the journey of reuniting with Daisy than the actual experience of being with her
<ul>
<li>Is this love or just a quest of obssession?</li>
<li>Everything suggests that Gatsby has no foundational sense of value except for Daisy, which shows that he is a very changeable and shallow person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby's wealth now seems worthless in comparison with Daisy</li>
<li>We realize that none of the characters have a long-term perception, and all of them live stuck in the moment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby achieving the dream of Daisy is ironically what consumes all purpose in his life</li>
<li>Success can destroy you</li>
<li><em>&quot;He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>The shirts are a manifestation of Gatsby's wealth</li>
<li>Gatsby's manner of impressing Daisy (and showing off) is blatantly materialistic</li>
<li>Excessive and wasteful in Gatsby's approach</li>
<li>An unusually, Daisy cries over Gatsby's shirts - she is someone who responds emotionally to material things, and she is a shallow person</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 19 (Pg. 91-92)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound. 
‘If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,’ said Gatsby. ‘You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.’ 
Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. 
I began to walk about the room, examining various in- definite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. 
‘Who’s this?’
‘ That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.’
The name sounded faintly familiar.
‘He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.’ There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen. 
‘I adore it!’ exclaimed Daisy. ‘ e pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.’ 
‘Look at this,’ said Gatsby quickly. ‘Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.’&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever...now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Though we've known about it all along, this is the first time that the green light is directly mentioned as the green light at the end of Daisy's dock</li>
<li>The green light has lost its enchanted value now that Daisy is here and he doesn't have much to look forward to
<ul>
<li>That green light was the Daisy that he had longed for</li>
<li>But now, it doesn't matter - reality has intruded on Gatsby's romantic imagination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Romantic concepts distort reality
<ul>
<li>It's easy to love someone from afar</li>
<li>But once they're close by they can be a disappointment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;‘Look at this,’ said Gatsby quickly. ‘Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.’&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Very stalker-ish behavior</li>
<li>It's a strange behavior and even stranger for Gatsby to share to Daisy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 20 (Pg. 96)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness...No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart. 
...I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.&quot;</em></li>
<li>Expresses the idea that Gatsby’s 5 year journey to reunite with Gatsby has made him out-of-touch with reality</li>
<li>Gatsby has become so preoccupied with the dream that no amount of real-life happiness could match his lofty expectations</li>
<li>As Nick says, “a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness” - he doubts whether his current happiness can be even real. Gatsby’s sojourn, as Nick says, had “...gone beyond her, beyond everything”</li>
<li>It becomes clear that once he is “forced” back into reality, when he truly has to take care of Daisy, the real person, not his imaginary analogue, Gatsby experiences a sense of disappointment</li>
<li>Daisy's whispers to Gatsby
<ul>
<li>Daisy's voice - connection to the Sirens in the <em>Odyssey</em> - it lures you to a fatal end</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby's dream is <em>&quot;creative passion&quot;</em> in that he has already imagined a life with Daisy before that has even come into being
<ul>
<li>And what's more, he's convinced himself that it's real</li>
<li>His creation is his artiface</li>
<li>Nick buys into it, while seeing that it's impossible, and it won't ever work
<ul>
<li>He enjoys watching it but he's also cynical of it</li>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>The rumors about Gatsby continue to circulate, and a reporter even travels to Gatsby’s mansion hoping to interview him</li>
<li>Nick then gives a brief biography of Gatsby's past:
<ul>
<li>Jay Gatsby is not Gatsby's actual name: he was called James Gatz, and he was born to poor parents in North Dakota</li>
<li>He dropped out of college when he was 17, fishing for salmon and digging for clams on Lake Superior</li>
<li>One day, he saw a yacht owned by Dan Cody, and rowed out to warn him about an impending storm</li>
<li>Cody took him aboard as his assistant</li>
<li>When Cody died, Gatsby was supposed to inherit his wealth, but Cody's surviving mistress took it instead</li>
<li>So instead, Gatsby, now penniless, resolved to make himself a wealthy man on his own</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One day, Nick stops at Gatsby's house, and is surprised to find Tom there</li>
<li>Tom is suspicious of Daisy’s habit of visiting Gatsby’s house alone</li>
<li>When Tom and Daisy go to a party at Gatsby’s house the next night, everyone has a bad time
<ul>
<li>Gatsby wants things to be exactly the same as they were before he left Louisville: he wants Daisy to leave Tom so that he can be with her, but Nick reminds Gatsby that he cannot re-create the past</li>
<li>But Gatsby believes that his money can accomplish anything he wants, <em>including</em> recreating the past</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick thinks about the first time Gatsby kissed Daisy, and reflects on the present</li>
<li>Note: this chapter has one of the most impactful lines in the entire novel:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.&quot;</p>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 21 (Pg. 98-99)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious at on Lake Superior...So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby was born to a family of farmers who were <em>&quot;shiftless and unsuccessful&quot;</em></li>
<li>For a long while, Gatsby had been dreaming about himself as a character called &quot;Jay Gatsby&quot;, a <em>&quot;platonic conception of himself&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Platonic&quot; refers to the idealistic vision of Gatsby, like the &quot;perfect form&quot; of which all things in Platonic philosophy are said to derive from; the world is simply an imperfect copy of the &quot;pure form&quot;, and similarly, James Gatz is an imperfect representation of the imagined &quot;Gatsby&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the age of 17, he sees Dan Cody's yatch and he warns him of the storm
<ul>
<li>When he introduces himself to Cody, this is the first time he refers himself as &quot;Jay Gatsby&quot;</li>
<li>And he became someone else to fulfill the dream of becoming &quot;Jay Gatsby&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4>Quote 22 &amp; 23 (Pg. 103-104, 109-111)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door. 
Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness...I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight...
Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The idea of over-sentimentality
<ul>
<li>Gatsby constantly asks for the impossible
<ul>
<li>He says <em>&quot;I’m going to fix <strong>everything</strong> just the way it was before&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>It's weird and creepy but also immature and childish</li>
<li>It's <em>magical thinking</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby isn't satisfied with just Daisy being with him
<ul>
<li>He wanted her to go to Tom and say that she <strong>never</strong> loved him</li>
<li>And of course it's impossible</li>
<li>But it's also for his benefit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's not just a journey to get Daisy in the now; it's a journey to get Daisy 5 years ago and erase the past 5 years</li>
<li>Theme: <strong>idealizing things destroys them</strong></li>
<li>And Gatsby's motivation is also somewhat selfish
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.&quot;</em></li>
<li>Gatsby wishes to realize his &quot;platonic conception&quot; of his romance with Daisy</li>
<li>So he romanticizes the past and wishes to recreate it
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, we talk about the &quot;good old days&quot; in America and are guilty of romanticizing the past</li>
<li>It's an appealing notion that the past was more wonderful than the present - but it certainly isn't true!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick romanticizes Gatsby's romance with Daisy but also expresses skeptic undertones</li>
<li>The physical setting of <em>&quot;A desolate path of fruit rinds&quot;</em> - while Gatsby is fantasizing about his magnificant ideas, he's also stepping in things that have been worn out and spent and discarded and has lost its value
<ul>
<li>There are fruit rinds <em>but</em> not fruit</li>
<li>Shows that his ideas </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nick allows Gatsby to do absolutely foolish things while he stays disinvolved and simply observes</li>
<li>Gatsby's flashback of him with Daisy 5 years ago:
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;... One autumn night, five years before&quot;</em></li>
<li>He seems alone until Daisy comes</li>
<li>During the kiss:
<ul>
<li>Gatsby is a dreamer, and the kiss is his incarnation of his dream</li>
<li>And now that his &quot;unutterable visions&quot; are wed with &quot;her perishible breath&quot;, he's both realized his dream, and his dream has lost its vitality - Gatsby's choice of being with Daisy has caused him to loose his autonomy</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>The day was the hottest day in summer</li>
<li>Gatsby calls off his parties, and fires his staff so that no one will know about him and Daisy</li>
<li>Nick is invited to Tom's house, where Daisy shows off her baby girl
<ul>
<li>Gatsby is stunned and can hardly believe that the child is real</li>
<li>He cannot accept that Tom and Daisy's marriage happened and they had a child together</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complaining of her boredom, Daisy asks Gatsby if he wants to go into the city</li>
<li>Gatsby stares at her passionately, and Tom becomes certain of their feelings for each other</li>
<li>At the Plaza Hotel, the group decides to take a suite
<ul>
<li>Tom begins the confrontation by mocking Gatsby</li>
<li>Gatsby replies that Daisy loves him, not Tom</li>
<li>Tom claims that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could not possibly understand</li>
<li>Tom then accuses Gatsby of gaining his wealth through his bootlegging operation</li>
<li>The final nail in the coffin is struck when Gatsby says that Daisy never loved Tom</li>
<li>Daisy cannot bear to accept this, and she loses her love for Gatsby</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tom, at this point victorious, sends Gatsby home with Daisy, proving that Gatsby's dreams are dashed
<ul>
<li>On the drive home, Myrtle sees the car (though Daisy is driving it), and she runs toward it, thinking it's Tom</li>
<li>Daisy hits her, and kills her instantly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After dropping off Daisy, Gatsby still believes that Daisy loves him, and he &quot;keeps watch&quot; over Daisy</li>
<li>But this is revealed to be no longer true, as Daisy and Tom have reconciled their differences, and Nick leaves Gatsby standing alone in the moonlight</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 24 (Pg. 116-117)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick . . . .”
“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.
As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.
“You know I love you,” she murmured.
“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.
Daisy looked around doubtfully.
“You kiss Nick too.”
“What a low, vulgar girl!”&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Immature behavior of all characters</li>
<li>Daisy demonstrates blatant infidelity within this passage, in contrast to her reserved demeanor
<ul>
<li>Shows that her way of reacting to happiness is being flirtatious with men</li>
<li>And her happiness is very shallow - she gets happy at anything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daisy kissing Gatsby while Tom is away is very indiscreet and careless - after all Tom is next door</li>
<li>Daisy says <em>&quot;She doesn’t look like her father&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>In Gatsby's fantasy, the last 5 years are not real</li>
<li>He had never believed in the child's existence before</li>
<li>To Gatsby it's a shock, because suddenly there is a very real &quot;byproduct&quot; of the marriage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 25 (Pg. 119)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”
“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”
Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space...
“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on — we’re all going to town.”
He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.
“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”
His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Going into car&quot;</em> - getting into a car is a frequent foreshadowing that something is going to go wrong
<ul>
<li>In literature, moving or travelling is often an escape from the constraints of the present location</li>
<li>Gatsby has said previously that <em>&quot;I can't [say some things] in his house...&quot;</em></li>
<li>When you change locations, more things become possible, and it creates the possibility of other changes</li>
<li>The stuff that will happen once they're in New York, couldn't happen in Tom's house</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;...between Gatsby and his wife&quot;</em> - shows the infidelity of Daisy, in that she regards Gatsby more as her husband than Tom</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 26 (Pg. 120-121)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads ——”
“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.
“I’ll get some whiskey,” answered Tom. He went inside.
Gatsby turned to me rigidly:
“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”
“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of ——” I hesitated.
“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.
That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In Tom’s house, Gatsby is limited in what he can do
<ul>
<li>Even though he’s already planned for “stealing Daisy away”, he feels that he can’t do so in Tom’s own house, which serves as the impetus to go to the city</li>
<li>Tom wants to assert his independence, and so he wishes to drive Gatsby’s car - a power move.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daisy’s voice was “charming”
<ul>
<li>She is perhaps a personification (or extended metaphor) for money, which constantly changes hands, can be pursued by men for their whole lives (like Gatsby has pursued Daisy) and while infinitely alluring, is also an instrument of destruction</li>
<li>There is a magical quality to her voice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tom has haughty remarks - <em>&quot;You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>It refers to illegal liquor being bootlegged via drug stores</li>
<li>Tom's specific remark is very dangerous to Gatsby, because it means (to Gatsby) that Tom knows his illegal source of income</li>
<li>exaggerated view of the world but typical of the 20s idea that “anything is possible”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Very awkwardly, Gatsby and Daisy are travelling together, while Tom, Daisy’s actual husband, is travelling separately</li>
<li>Driving foreshadows a crash
<ul>
<li>The very hot day (without air conditioning for that matter!) would only make things worse</li>
<li>The scene sets up a pressure cooker for what is about to happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 27 (Pg. 124-125)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before — and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>The unbearable heat has caused both Tom and Wilson to react too slowly as the disaster unfolds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identity has become muddled and easily changeable
<ul>
<li>Despite their differences in wealth and social status, both Tom and Wilson have been levelled (<em>&quot;physically sick&quot;</em>) by their discovery, mere hours apart, that their (respective) wife is involved with another man - <em>&quot;...it occurred to me that there was no difference between [the two] men&quot;</em></li>
<li>Myrtle becomes jealous when she sees Jordan in the car with Tom - a massive misunderstanding, because she thinks that Jordan is Daisy, and is jealous of Tom being with &quot;Daisy&quot; (Jordan)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple overlaid ironies
<ul>
<li>Despite his wealth and prestige Tom cannot stop the disaster which is looming</li>
<li>His secrets are soon to be discovered and he is surprisingly vulnerable</li>

</li>
<li>Nick is staying out of it and entertained about it

<li>He's ice-cold, dispassionate about the situation</li>
<li>He does not care</li>

</li>
<li>Permanent changes
<ul>
<li>Wilson decides to move away to “get away” from Tom</li>
<li>Tom realized that he will lose his wife and mistress even though he’s kept them secret for so long - <em>&quot;Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control&quot;</em></li>

<h4>Quote 28 (Pg. 130-132)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”
At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain — as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.
...“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter anymore. Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it’s all wiped out forever.”
She looked at him blindly. “Why — how could I love him — possibly?”
“You never loved him.”
She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing — and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.
“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.
...“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancor was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said — but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.
“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now — isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once — but I loved you too.”
Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.
“You loved me too?” he repeated.
...the words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Power struggle between Gatsby and Tom
<ul>
<li>Yet Nick is dispassionate throughout the entire passage - he doesn’t want to be near it, and he wants to “walk away from the train wreck”</li>
<li>Tom’s control-obsessed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daisy's voice <em>“filled the room with thrilling scorn”</em> - great contrast with the previous description of her voice</li>
<li>&quot;Platonic conceptions&quot;
<ul>
<li>In Gatsby's mind, Daisy exists like the perfect image of Daisy he wants her to be</li>
<li>Great ideas that are diminished when they need to be made real</li>
<li>Gatsby is in love with the <em>idea</em> of Daisy, not the real Daisy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby is never concerned about Daisy’s wishes - in fact he tries to pressure her
<ul>
<li>Daisy’s not all into what Gatsby wants her to say - Daisy refuses Tom with reluctance, and finally cannot continue under the pressure with <em>“oh, you want too much!”</em></li>
<li>Because Gatsby does really ask for too much!</li>
<li>Gatsby wants the past 5 years to be erased - something that he could never have</li>
<li>Gatsby cannot take the one imperfection in his dream, and that destroys him</li>
<li>Gatsby was destroyed by his own hands because he pushes it a little too far, trying to make it perfect, and he loses it all</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Message: Being happy with the successes you have, and not to aim for the successes you didn't achieve</li>
<li>The destructive nature of idealism: we dream so hard we can't live our reality</li>
<li>Daisy says <em>&quot;I did love him once — but I loved you too&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>The word <em>&quot;too&quot;</em> is inclusive to Daisy, but destructive to Gatsby - it shatters his dream because he can't accept being an <em>&quot;also&quot;</em></li>

<h4>Quote 29a (Pg. 143-145)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.
The voice begged again to go.
“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”
Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage, she had had, were definitely gone.
“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”
She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.
'Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.'&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Nick's birthday is on the same day of the conflict/confrontation
<ul>
<li>The age of 30 is often thought of a turing point for maturity - once you turn 30, you become a grown-up person</li>
<li>Nick however fails to rise up to the occasion</li>
<li>In fact Nick is so preoccupied with the lives of others that he forgets it's his birthday</li>
<li>And considering the situation that just happened, it seems tone-deaf - it is completely out of place</li>
<li>Conversely Nick's over-emphasis of him turning 30 is somewhat unusual as well, since life doesn't just suddenly take a sharp turn when you turn thirty
<ul>
<li>Nick's being melodramatic - he wants to think in a categorical, pessimistic way</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;“Who was the woman?” he inquired.
“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”
“Well, I tried to swing the wheel ——” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.
“Was Daisy driving?”
“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive — and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock — it must have killed her instantly.”
“It ripped her open ——”
“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow — Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>While Daisy and Gatsby were driving back, their car accidentally strikes Myrtle as she is on the road</li>
<li>Gatsby reveals to Nick that Daisy was driving the car, but he intends to take the blame for the accident</li>
<li>Neither Gatsby nor Daisy know the significance of the woman they killed (i.e. they didn't know it's Tom's wife)</li>
<li>Yet while Nick knows, he doesn't reveal it</li>
<li>The way Gatsby tells the story, the most important issue is how Daisy felt - not the legal issues they've both accrued, not the fact that they both fled the scene of the accident, not the fact that there is now a dead person
<ul>
<li>Leaving the scene after manslaughter, after all, is a serious crime, and Gatsby will go to jail</li>
<li>Yet Gatsby dismisses it - <em>&quot;...but of course I’ll say I was&quot;</em> - he's being super protective of her</li>
<li>And the car is Gatsby's own car!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby decides to stand outside in the dark to &quot;keep watch&quot; on Daisy in case Tom intervenes</li>
<li>Gatsby thinks Daisy would <em>&quot;turn the light on and off&quot;</em> if there is trouble
<ul>
<li>Yet that isn't what's actually happening</li>
<li>Daisy's affair with Gatsby is <em>already</em> permanently over</li>
<li>In fact, Daisy and Tom are having a normal night</li>
<li>It is inferred that Daisy and Tom are going to frame Gatsby for the accident - <em>&quot;they were conspiring together&quot;</em> - and they'll move on together once Gatsby's gone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's clear that since Nick sees all of this, he should at least tell Gatsby
<ul>
<li>Yet he doesn't share and leaves Gatsby on the hook</li>
<li>Nick leaves him <em>&quot;watching over nothing&quot;</em></li>
<li>Instead of taking care of his friend, to Nick, it makes for a better story, it seems more romantically</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now Nick is guilty of the same crimes as Daisy and Gatsby, since he knows about the crime and doesn't report of the crime (he is an accomplice)
<ul>
<li>Nick is as guilty of any of them, even though he tells a story where the others are the &quot;bad people&quot; and he is the sole &quot;good&quot; character</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gatsby's choice of dropping off Daisy at her husband's house, instead of fleeing away with her (at the exact moment when they had the best chance of running away together), makes no sense, morally or rationally
<ul>
<li>It's a total disaster and never going to work</li>
<li>Yet Nick sees what we see, and he doesn't point this out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Essentially, Gatsby helps Daisy cover up a crime, and Nick, by keeping silent, causes all of them to be in trouble</li>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 30 (Pg. 148-150)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Description of Daisy as a “nice” girl - “nice” refers to wealth and beauty, not character and morality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gatsby decides to lie to impress and seduce Daisy</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on how Nick tells the story, he describes their intimacy as Gatsby “taking” her as a euphemized version of rape, especially because it is described as “ravenous and unscrupulous”.</li>
<li>It is consistent with the idea that Gatsby is okay with lying to get what he wants - after all, he</li>
<li>It’s Nick’s description, and he talks about it in a conquering sort of way. What he states as romantic is actually rough and course.</li>
<li>Notably, one thing that the <em>&quot;great&quot;</em>_ Gatsby has done is to have taken a woman under false pretenses.</li>
<li>In the book, Daisy might as well be an object - we don't know anything about her except for her voice, and there doesn't seem to be anything of substance in her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gatsby knows that Daisy is desired by other men, which apparently makes her valuable, which in turn makes her seem like a trophy/prize</p>
<ul>
<li>Yet individuals have intrinsic value in themselves, not the value assigned to them from other people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gatsby is attracted to wealth because it helps him distance himself away from his family and his childhood of poverty</p>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby look at wealthy people as if they are special in some way</li>
<li>Nick is no different, he also looks at Gatsby (a wealthy person) as if his wealth alone made him special</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>&quot;...but what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there...&quot;</em> It's apparently a magical place because it's attached to Daisy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>&quot;But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident&quot;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby was of lower socioeconomic status and was a soldier, very much not Daisy's equal</li>

<ul>
<li>Everyone wants the grail just because it's the grail; simultaneously, Daisy is supposedly valuable because others find her valuable</li>
<li>No one knows anything about the grail, except that everyone wants it; similarly, there is nothing about Daisy's essense which Gatsby knows or talks about, just that she is sought after</li>
<li>Daisy is magical in Gatsby's perception (or conception) of her; we learn nothing of her substance to support this</li>
<li>What Gatsby wants to believe, and what story Nick wishes to tell you, is <strong>not</strong> reality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 31 (Pg. 150-152)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby, heartbroken, decides to revisit the places he went with Daisy to re-experience them and &quot;bring back&quot; the past</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 32 (Pg. 153-154)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The draining pool is an allusion to Gatsby's dream &quot;going down the drain&quot;</li>
<li>Contrast between <em>&quot;I didn't want to leave Gatsby&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;I disapproved of him from beginning to end&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick’s not aware that he’s saying contradictory things</li>
<li>Nick likes to verbally “downgrade” a person immediately after he appears to give a compliment - he does this because he wants to give the impression of the superior person (morally or otherwise)</li>
<li>Remember, Nick is paying the compliment to Gatsby (doing something that looks like a good friend), while ironically <em>not</em> being a good friend</li>
<li>Nick has spent enormous effort maintaining the illusion of Gatsby's romantic conception of reality, but he doesn't actually do much to help him, make a difference, or tell him the truth
<ul>
<li>He does all of these things for the sake of telling a good story and looking good</li>
<li>Nick knows things that could change things - he's leaving Gatsby alone and misinforming him</li>
<li>So Nick is incredibly self-serving</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The scene and atmosphere creates the feeling that &quot;summer is going to end&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 21 (Pg. 158-160)</h4>
<h4>Quote 22 (Pg. 161)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was any one to give it to if it came&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby keeps expecting a call from Daisy, but it never comes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything is about Daisy, and when Daisy leaves, it takes everything beautiful in the world with it. Because of that, Gatsby’s given up on everything.</li>
<li>But - that is not fair to reality. A rose is beautiful because it is beautiful, not because of what Gatsby thinks or says</li>
<li>Daisy’s name is a fragile flower, alluding to the fragile quality of Gatsby's dream</li>
<li>Gatsby has a nihilistic attitude towards life, seeing all of reality as unreal
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat weird; remember, the one thing that was never real with his dream about Daisy, and now that it has been proven to be unreal, Gatsby paradoxically thinks that everything is unreal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>single dream</strong>
<ul>
<li>A dream so important to you that everything else doesn't matter anymore</li>
<li>And Gatsby has put everything in his singular dream</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now, 2 years have passed since Gatsby's death</li>
<li>Nick and only a few of Gatsby's friends and family attend the funeral</li>
<li>Tom and Daisy have moved away</li>
<li>Nick breaks up with Jordan</li>
<li>And Nick decides to move away too</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<h4>Quote 35 (Pg. 177)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nick comes to Jordan to smooth it over to prevent Jordan from damaging his reputation, not because he truly cares for her</li>
<li><em>&quot;“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I?&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>When they had the initial conservation, Jordan says that she wants to be with (become engaged to) him, because he seems like a careful person</li>
<li>Nick is unfortunately only careful about himself, not about others
<ul>
<li>He has no long-term intention of marriage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jordan was trusting Nick to stay with her, and then he ghosts her (vanishes for a long period of time and ignores her), which is pretty heartless</li>
<li>So Jordan accuses Nick of being careless with her and a &quot;bad driver&quot;
<ul>
<li>As with before, in the Midwest, Nick decides to deceive a woman and suggests to her that he'll marry her, then leaves her - it's the same pattern</li>
<li>Nick lies to Jordan to get what he wants out of the sexual relationship, like he did earlier
<ul>
<li>The dishonesty is part of who Nick is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 36 (Pg. 178-179)</h4>
<ul>
<li>With Gatsby dead, Nick wanders alone</li>
<li>Gatsby was once surrounded by hundreds of the rich and wealthy
<ul>
<li>Yet he dies alone in a pool</li>
<li>Nobody comes in his funeral, because nobody remembers him</li>
<li>He's lost his life because of his dream</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When Nick sees Tom again, he refuses to shake hands with him</li>
<li>Nick goes to condemn Tom and Daisy, making his first judgement
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>_<em>Except</em>...he keeps this judgement to himself, and doesn't accuse Tom of it
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;I couldn’t forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.&quot;</em></li>
<li>While this is true, it is ironic that Nick's got his own carelessness</li>
<li>And it is even more ironic that right after he takes this moral stance, he shakes Tom's hand anyway - <em>&quot;I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick just doesn't want to take a stand when it's difficult</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true. &quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Nick knows exactly what he could say, except he doesn't say it</li>
<li>He appreciates the irony of knowing something and not saying it, because the &quot;story version&quot; of it is a rich ironic moment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People who are great successes also tend to cast off their origins and abandoning their parents to become who they are now</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quote 37 (Pg. 180, last page of book)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... &quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>This is the <strong>core idea</strong> of the Great Gatsby - we appear to be seeking a future of happiness, but in fact, we are often really trying to seek a long-gone past that we cannot return to</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ultimate message of book</h2>
<ul>
<li>We keep trying to strive forward, but whenever we strive forward, we often take a step back</li>
</ul>
