        <h1>Political &amp; Economic Change and Development</h1>
<h2>Economic Diversification</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic complexity</strong> is the measure of the diversity of a country's exports</li>
<li>A nation without a complex economy is especially vulnerable to market shocks due to its singular export and the struggle to control the one exported resource can cause major civil unrest</li>
<li>Some nations experience what is described as a <strong>resource curse</strong> where the abundance of natural resources can ironically cause</li>
</ul>
<h3>Economic Complexity of Case Study Countries</h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Economic complexity score (higher = more complex)</th><th>Chief Import &amp; Export</th><th>Largest Trading Partner</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td>Iran</td><td>-0.095 (65 of 127)</td><td>Import: electronics and equipment; export: ethylene polymers (used to make plastics)</td><td>China</td></tr>

<h2>Nigeria's Economy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nigeria is the classic example of the <strong>rentier state</strong> - a state that derives a significant portion of its revenue from the rent of land leased to foreign companies</li>
<li>The majority of profits from Nigeria’s oil and gas industry is taken by foreign companies, and corruption has rendered the Nigerian government unable to provide for the country’s domestic energy needs, leading to frequent outages and requiring Nigeria to import most of the oil it needs</li>
<li>Those in power do not serve Nigeria’s interest, but rather, those who are in control of the oil. The government actively participates or ignores in corruption. Thus, Nigerians do not benefit from the country’s oil profit, and generally do not feel proud to be Nigerian</li>
