        <h1>Political Participation</h1>
<h2>What is Political Participation?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Political participation is defined as the proces by which the public can express their political opinions and extert their influence on political decisions</li>
<li>Voter turnout is a good measure of political participation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Political Participation throughout history</h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>Amendment</th><th>Summarize Amendment</th><th>Historical Context</th><th>Significance of Amendment</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xv">15th</a></td><td>Prohibits denial of the franchise on account of race</td><td>Reconstruction; Southern states attempted to restrict franchise using voting tax/literacy tests/etc. Republican-controlled Congress attempted to mitigate these issues</td><td>Established a brief period (~15 years) where African Americans were able to vote consistently; first black senators; removal of barriers to vote</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii">17th</a></td><td>Provides for the popular election of senators</td><td>Late 19th - early 20th century; political machines allowed party bosses to control state legislatures so as to appoint their favored representatives</td><td>Increased participation in elections for the Senate; stopped state legislatures from having control over their senators; reducing the accountability of state legislatures</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xix">19th</a></td><td>Prohibits denial of franchise on account of sex</td><td>Women's rights movement; notion that half of the population was barred from the franchise</td><td>Established that women were granted the right to vote under the Constitution</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxiv">24th</a></td><td>Protects all people from being denied their right to vote due to poll taxes</td><td>In many southern states after the 15th amendment was passed, poll taxes were reintroduced, along with literacy tests and other measures as a way of undermining the amendment</td><td>Protected citizens right to vote by eliminating poll taxes that might make it difficult for them to vote</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxvi">26th</a></td><td>Grants the right to vote for American citizens of the age 18 or older.</td><td>In most states, the voting age was 21 and older, but in the Vietnam war many 18-20 year olds were getting drafted, so people called for the voting age to be lowered to 18+</td><td>Extending the right to vote, established more young people with the ability of shaping the US (voting).</td></tr>

<h2>Ways to increase political participation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Election Day as national holiday</li>
<li>Require voters to vote by law</li>
<li>Improve civic and political education -&gt; improves interest and efficacy</li>
<li>Incentives -&gt; monetary compensation for election</li>
<li>Better candidates</li>
<li>Voter drives, motor voter, electronic vote, mail-in vote -&gt; simplifying the voting process</li>
<li>Free transporation to vote + polls everywhere especially in rural areas</li>
</ul>
<h2>Political parties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Political parties, interest groups, and social movements are <strong>linkage institutions</strong>: channels that allow individuals to pariticiplate in the policy-making process, and influence how people relate to government</li>
<li>Political parties are:
<ul>
<li>A label in voters' minds
<ul>
<li>Crafts a message that appeals to them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An organization</li>
<li>A set of leaders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>functions</strong> of political parties include:
<ul>
<li>Mobilization and (political) education to influence voters</li>
<li>Party platforms</li>
<li>Candidate recruitment (cultivating a candidate to win and represent the party, and getting them to follow party line)</li>
<li>Campaign management, including fundraising and media strategy</li>
<li>The committee and party leadership systems in legislatures (e.g. in Congress)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Techniques used by political parties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canvassing
<ul>
<li>Direct contact with people (knock on doors)</li>
<li>Get out vote drives</li>
<li>Campaigns</li>
<li>Awareness efforts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Structures of political parties</h3>
<ul>
<li>National-level</li>
<li>State-level</li>
<li>Local-level</li>
</ul>
<h3>Can a candidate &quot;be&quot; the party?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The nominees of a poltical party are nominally also representatives of it</li>
<li>But this is not necessarily true</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power and Influence of Political Parties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Senators can be incentivized to pass bills in line with their party agendas</li>
<li>And parties can make sure senators fall in line and/or stay silent; otherwise, political suicide!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Party platforms</h2>
<h3>Republican Platform</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pro-life</li>
<li>Small government</li>
<li>For stronger national defense and a more hawkish foreign policy</li>
<li>Deregulation</li>
<li>Lower taxes</li>
<li>Harsh stance on illegal immigration + immigration restriction</li>
<li>Capitalism/free markets/pro-business</li>
<li>Pro-death penalty, hard on crime</li>
</ul>
<h3>Democratic Platform</h3>
<h2>Party change and adaptation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Parties have adapted to candidate-centered campaigns, and their role in nominating candidates has been weakened</li>
<li>Parties use communication technology and voter data management to disseminate, control, and clarify political messages and enhance outreach and mobilization efforts.</li>
<li>Parties modify their policies and messaging to reach out to various demographical coalitions</li>
<li>Party structure can be changed by:
<ul>
<li>Critical elections and regional realignments</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Campaign finance law</li>
<li>Changes in communication and data management technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Critical elections and Party realignment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical Elections</strong> - an electoral &quot;earthquake&quot; where new issues and coalitions emerge</li>
<li><strong>Party Realignment</strong> - the <em>lasting</em> displacement of the majority party by the minority party, often during or just after a critical election (e.g. the New Deal coalition in 1932). This is usually involves:
<ul>
<li>Conversion -&gt; existing voters switch parties OR</li>
<li>Mobilization -&gt; new voters come into the electorate and choose a party overwhelmingly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Structural Barriers and Third Parties</h2>
<h3>Why are third-parties disadvantaged?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In comparison to proportional systems, winner-take-all voting districts serve as a <strong>structural barrier</strong> to third-party and independent candidate success</li>
<li>The absorption of third-party agendas into platforms of major political parties serves as another <strong>structural barrier</strong> to third parties</li>
</ul>
<h3>Structural Barrier 1: Voting system</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;First past the post&quot; or &quot;winner takes all&quot; systems just require a majority to win:
<ul>
<li>One vote per citizen</li>
<li>Candidate for most votes win</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Single member distincts (voting by districts only)
<ul>
<li>Encourages party umbrella to get more people </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Discourages minor/third parties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issues with first past the post:
<ul>
<li>Minority rule -&gt; doesn't need a majority to win</li>
<li>Results in an inevitable two-party system</li>
<li>The spoiler effect -&gt; the better a third-party system does, the more it detracts from the party that the third-party voters most identify with</li>
<li>The system is polarized and doesn't allow for nuance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Media as a Linkage Institution</h2>
<ul>
<li>All presidents need to interact with the media</li>
<li>Media can influence policy-making</li>
<li>However, this leads to controversy:
<ul>
<li>Factual and opinionated statements can be hard to destinguish</li>
<li>Lack of digital literacy can lead to fake institutions portraying themselves as reliable sources</li>
<li>People typically tend to overly trust the same media sources and not let their views be challenged</li>
<li>Media channels can be too focused on viewership (and money) and not on actual facts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roles of the media</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Gatekeeper</strong> - telling people what info's important
<ul>
<li>But do they over- or under-stress the importance of an issue?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Watchdog</strong> - keeps the government accountable (&quot;tough journalism&quot;, muckraking, leaking government reports of corruption/abuses of power)
<ul>
<li>But do they hold all politicians <em>equally</em> accountable?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Scorekeeper</strong> - reports on elections, races, pollings, rivalries (&quot;horse-race politics&quot;)</li>
<li>The <strong>Entertainer</strong> - commentary about headlines (&quot;yellow journalism&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Biases</h2>
<ul>
<li>A good overview of common biases is available [here](http://archive.mrc.org/books/identifybias.asp](http://archive.mrc.org/books/identifybias.asp)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules Governing the Media</h2>
<ul>
<li>Newspapers - least government regulation</li>
<li>Radio and TV (but <strong>not</strong> cable news!) - most government regulation (FCC-regulated, can revoke operating license)
<ul>
<li>&quot;Fairness doctrine&quot; - fair and balanced coverage of controversial issues, abolished in 2011</li>
<li>&quot;Right of reply&quot; - allows a person who is attacked on a braodcase to respond to the attack</li>
<li>&quot;Equal-time rule&quot; - equal access for all candidates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confidentially of Sources (reporters don't have to reveal their source, &quot;anonymous sources&quot;)</li>
<li>Broadcasting - regulated</li>
<li>The Internet - no regulation at all</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interest Groups and their influence on policy making</h2>
<p><strong>Interest groups</strong>: groups of people who come together in order to get policies they favor enacted.</p>
<h3>Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Educate voters and office holders</li>
<li>Conduct lobbying</li>
<li>Draft legislation</li>
<li>Mobilize membership to apply pressure on and work with legislators</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Join an Interest Group?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solidarity incentive</strong>: social benefits like companionship and being with like-minded people</li>
<li><strong>Material incentives</strong>: money, or things worth money</li>
<li><strong>Purposive incentives</strong>: reward is serving a purpose</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interest Group Influence</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Cue</strong>: signal that tells legislator or public how to feel about a certain issue</li>
<li><strong>Ratings</strong>: &quot;assessment&quot; of a representative's voting record on relevant issues</li>
<li><strong>Amicus Curiae brief</strong> (for SCOTUS)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Endorsements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Endorsements from <strong>well-connected</strong> or <strong>a large number</strong> of interest groups provide informative signals to members of Congress reviewing legislation</li>
<li>The value of this signal can be significant in the later stages of the legislative </li>
<li>Big interest groups have huge leverage with their endorsements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lobbying</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the broadest possible sense, lobbying is petitioning a politician or a group of people to vote in a certain way</li>
<li>This could be done by private citizens, but also by paid professionals
<ul>
<li>Can be beneficial or malicious</li>
<li>But it can be easily abused: e.g. Private sector CEOs can often lobby for legislation that can make their lives easier later</li>
<li>Lobbying can be a professional boon for politicians to get legislation through</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
