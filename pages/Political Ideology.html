        <h1>Political Ideology</h1>
<h2>Political Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Short definition: A shared set of values or beliefs</li>
<li>Longer definition: A sustained way of thinking in how political and economic life (government) ought to be carried out</li>
</ul>
<h3>Distinctly American Characteristics of Political Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diversity</li>
<li>Healthy competition</li>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Egalitarianism</li>
<li>Individualism</li>
<li>Equality of opportunity</li>
<li>Freedom</li>
<li>Free enterprise</li>
<li>Rule of law</li>
<li>Limited government</li>
</ul>
<h3>Polling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Polling on Americans reflect that most believe in shared ideals, yet differ in the interpretation of these ideals</li>
<li>It's also typically the case that most Americans believe that American ideals (e.g. democracy, freedom, equality) are important, but few believe that the ideals are reflected in real life</li>
<li>Unfortunately, Americans are heavily politically polarized; large majorities of Democrats and Republicans view the other party unfavorably</li>
<li>It is typically in the aftermath of traumatic events and/or a common enemy (e.g. Pearl Harbor, 9/11 attacks) that serve as a catalyst to unite us</li>
</ul>
<h4>Important factors of polling effectiveness</h4>
<ul>
<li>Good samples
<ul>
<li>Random</li>
<li>Specific time</li>
<li>Proportional</li>
<li>Large enough sample size of ~800-1000 people (problem due to inequality of access, low response rates, and price)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type of poll (internet v. live caller v. IVR poll v. landline v. cell phone)</li>
<li>Language barrier</li>
<li>Who picks up the phone? (typically more politically active voters, which skews data)</li>
<li>Dealing with bias in demographics (e.g. underrepresented groups)</li>
<li>The skills of interviewers/pollsters (and their education and background)</li>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>Order of questions</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>How a question is worded</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Types of Poll</h4>
<ul>
<li>Opinion Polls
<ul>
<li>Benchmark Polls
<ul>
<li>Poll to gauge support of potential run of a cnadidate</li>
<li><strong>Focus groups</strong> are good for this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Entrance Polls
<ul>
<li>Poll taken before voters cast their ballot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exti Polls
<ul>
<li>Poll taken right after voters cast their ballot</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Focus Groups</h4>
<p>A focus group is a group interview involving a small number of demographically different participants to find their reactions.</p>
<h3>Traditional Agents of Political Socialization</h3>
<p>Political beliefs are often influenced by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Peers</li>
<li>Education/geography</li>
<li>Media (News/social media)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in Political Socialization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Religion is generally less significant in the lives of younger voters - secularism is increasing</li>
<li>&quot;Traditional&quot; v. &quot;modern&quot; values can drive political ideology and culture</li>
<li>Progress is often a conflict of traditional v. modern values</li>
<li>The percieved decline and/or threat of religion causes more to cling tightly to it, and this is often used by politicians to win votes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Political Climate</h3>
<p>Note that political climate is <strong>not</strong> the same as political culture! Political climate is the measure of the general mood and opinions of society at a certain time.</p>
<p>We often say that political climate was far less polarized and more civil previously. The tendency to disagree without being disagreeable was much greater previously.</p>
<h2>Influences of political ideology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Generational effects: the Great Depression, World War II, Cold War, and other historical events have greatly influenced voters</li>
<li>Political events: e.g. the Watergate Scandal</li>
<li>Lifecycle effects: e.g. student debt, taxes for businesses, arrest by police, etc</li>
</ul>

<h3>Social Cleavages</h3>

<ul>
<li>Internal: believes that a person can make an impact on the political system</li>
<li>External: believes the government is responsive to the people's needs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal policy</strong> is <em>how</em> money is spent and what things will be in the budget</li>
<li><strong>Monetary policy</strong> is control over the interest rates or the money supply</li>
</ul>
