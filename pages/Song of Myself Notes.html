        <h1>&quot;Song of Myself&quot; Notes</h1>
<p>Jacky Song</p>
<h2>Big Picture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Whitman wants you to &quot;enjoy the moment you're in&quot;
<ul>
<li>He often incorporates ideas that his wandering mind stumbles upon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He isn't interested in the formality or style of his poem
<ul>
<li>It is a freeing and independent style, unconstrained, which creates a distinctly American style of poetry</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who is Whitman?</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Working-man poet&quot; style</li>
<li>One of the transcendentalists
<ul>
<li>Celebration of self, the individual</li>
<li>It is okay, even useful to be nonconformist</li>
<li>Celelbration of what makes us uniquely American</li>
<li>Glorifies nature</li>
<li>Transcendence - we are meant to leave (&quot;transcend&quot;) the physical body and connect and become one with the universe
<ul>
<li>For knowledge</li>
<li>For self-exploration</li>
<li>For inner peace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-reliance and free thought</li>
<li>Celebrates the common, everyday people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I help myself to material and immaterial,
No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
<h3>Essential Themes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transcendent power of love, brotherhood, and comradeship</li>
<li>The myriad connection underlying all things</li>
<li>Imaginative projection into others' lives</li>
<li>Optimistic faith in democracy and equality</li>
<li>Belief in the regnerative and illustrative powers of nature and its value as a teahcer</li>
<li>Equivalence of body and soul and the unabashed exaltation of the body (including sexuality)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Poetic Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li>Free verse: lack of metrical regularity and conventional rhyme, completely unrestricted
Use of repeated images, symbols, phrases, and grammatical units</li>
<li>Use of enumerations and catalogs</li>
<li>Use of anaphora (initial repetition) in lines, and ephanaphora between lines</li>
<li>Contrast and parallelism in paired lines</li>
<li>Thus, he paves the way for a truly &quot;American&quot; way of writing - free, individualist, plain, irreverent, expressive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>Idiosyncratic spelling and punctuation</li>
<li>Words used for their sounds as much as their sense; foreign feel</li>
<li>Uses specialized words, including words from other languages, nautical terms, scientific terms, business terms, carpentry terms, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Imagery</h3>
<ul>
<li>When first published, Whitman was described as obscene for its over sexuality</li>
<li>However, it is more likely that Whitman sought to simply clear sexuality from its traditionally sinful-perceived nature</li>
<li>Whitman equates the passion and joy in sexuality in other areas of life and nature</li>
<li>And Whitman is trying to grapple with his individualism in a very shunning society</li>
</ul>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;All men live lives of quiet desperation&quot;</em> -&gt; by Henry Thoreau, one of Whitman's contemporaries</li>
<li>Whitman's writing is a rebellion against the rigid moral norms and standards of society, preferring a world in which all things are holy and good and worthy of love</li>
</ul>
<h2>Connected pieces</h2>
<h3><em>Self Reliance</em> by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h3>
<p>(Port notes from notebook)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is a time...that [every man] arrives at the conviction that <strong>envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You're not supposed to be like or do things like someone else: doing so is a suicide of the self; instead, you should be who you are</li>
<li>Being someone we are not is just as damaging to the soul as suicide</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whoso would be a man, must be a <strong>nonconformist</strong>...nothing is at last sacred but the <strong>integrity of your own mind</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emerson sees it necessary to not bow to any pressure or influence from others; more simply, you've got to follow yourself, and your independence is what's most imporant</li>
<li>Here comes the paradox though: what happens if you use your own power to act against society? What prevents you from taking individualism too far?</li>
<li>Thus, there has to be a balancing act where we set <em>limits</em> on the importance of the individual</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature...the only right is what is after my constitution&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Conscience comes from the self, not from the labels of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; from other people</li>
<li>However, we could justify nearly any action by the adage &quot;it's good because works for me&quot; (self-serving), including societally unacceptable things</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Essentially: others' opinions don't matter: if there is something that I feel is right, I need to do it</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...but the great man is he who in the midst of the crow keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The great man is great because he can live among others peacefully, but still follow their inner compass</li>
<li>Whereas many others would deliberately ignore their own judgement and evidence and join in with the crowd</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key ideas</h4>
<ul>
<li>According Emerson, we should always try to forge our own path instead of copying someone else</li>
<li>Conformity is not a virtue, it is a hindrance, and thus society has an adverse effect on people's growth</li>
<li>In other words, Emerson believed through working on ourselves, we grow to be self-reliant to the point that we no longer envy others, but measure ourself against only ourselves</li>
<li>When we become self-reliant, we focus on creating, rather than imitating</li>
</ul>
<h4>Responses to the concept of &quot;self-reliance&quot;</h4>
<ul>
<li>NY Times - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/magazine/riff-ralph-waldo-emerson.html">&quot;The Foul Reign of Emerson's 'self-reliance'&quot;</a> - some quotes:
<ul>
<li>&quot;The 'excessive love' of individual liberty over national unity&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The 'plague of devices' that keep us staring into the shallow puddle of our dopamine reactions [as verification of our own self-importance]&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...Our fetish for....the American afflication of ignoring volumes of evidence in favor of flashes that meet the eye&quot;</li>
<li>Idea: we've been taught to be self-interested so much that we forget the importance of the things that matter</li>
<li>Emerson's thinking allowed us to lose the value of the real world</li>
<li>&quot;The larger problem with the essay...has been Emerson's tacit endorsement of a radically self-centered worldview&quot; - that is, Emerson allows us having a self-centered worldview</li>
</ul>
</li>
