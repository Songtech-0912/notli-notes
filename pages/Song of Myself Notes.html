        <h1>&quot;Song of Myself&quot; Notes</h1>
<p>Jacky Song</p>
<h2>Big Picture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Whitman wants you to &quot;enjoy the moment you're in&quot;
<ul>
<li>He often incorporates ideas that his wandering mind stumbles upon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He isn't interested in the formality or style of his poem
<ul>
<li>It is a freeing and independent style, unconstrained, which creates a distinctly American style of poetry</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who is Whitman?</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Working-man poet&quot; style</li>
<li>One of the transcendentalists
<ul>
<li>Celebration of self, the individual</li>
<li>It is okay, even useful to be nonconformist</li>
<li>Celelbration of what makes us uniquely American</li>
<li>Glorifies nature</li>
<li>Transcendence - we are meant to leave (&quot;transcend&quot;) the physical body and connect and become one with the universe
<ul>
<li>For knowledge</li>
<li>For self-exploration</li>
<li>For inner peace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-reliance and free thought</li>
<li>Celebrates the common, everyday people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I help myself to material and immaterial,
No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
<h3>Essential Themes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transcendent power of love, brotherhood, and comradeship</li>
<li>The myriad connection underlying all things</li>
<li>Imaginative projection into others' lives</li>
<li>Optimistic faith in democracy and equality</li>
<li>Belief in the regnerative and illustrative powers of nature and its value as a teahcer</li>
<li>Equivalence of body and soul and the unabashed exaltation of the body (including sexuality)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Poetic Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li>Free verse: lack of metrical regularity and conventional rhyme, completely unrestricted
Use of repeated images, symbols, phrases, and grammatical units</li>
<li>Use of enumerations and catalogs</li>
<li>Use of anaphora (initial repetition) in lines, and ephanaphora between lines</li>
<li>Contrast and parallelism in paired lines</li>
<li>Thus, he paves the way for a truly &quot;American&quot; way of writing - free, individualist, plain, irreverent, expressive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>Idiosyncratic spelling and punctuation</li>
<li>Words used for their sounds as much as their sense; foreign feel</li>
<li>Uses specialized words, including words from other languages, nautical terms, scientific terms, business terms, carpentry terms, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Imagery</h3>
<ul>
<li>When first published, Whitman was described as obscene for its over sexuality</li>
<li>However, it is more likely that Whitman sought to simply clear sexuality from its traditionally sinful-perceived nature</li>
<li>Whitman equates the passion and joy in sexuality in other areas of life and nature</li>
<li>And Whitman is trying to grapple with his individualism in a very shunning society</li>
</ul>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;All men live lives of quiet desperation&quot;</em> -&gt; by Henry Thoreau, one of Whitman's contemporaries</li>
<li>Whitman's writing is a rebellion against the rigid moral norms and standards of society, preferring a world in which all things are holy and good and worthy of love</li>
</ul>
