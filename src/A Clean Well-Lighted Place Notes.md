### Quotes

- *"I am of those who like to stay late at the café...with all those who do not want to go to bed...with all those who need a light for the night.*

- *The tables were all empty except where the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the wind*

### Analysis

In *A Clean, Well-Lighted Place*, Hemingway conveys the idea that life is meaningless. He describes how an old man, sitting within the aforementioned café, had attempted suicide for "nothing", and has been spending the remainder of his days drinking away. While the younger, more materialist waiter objects to the old man, the older waiter shares the old man's sentiments, and begins his own exposition of the "nothingness" he fears. The experiences of both have left them with "nothing" - the older waiter describes himself as "nothing but a job", and the old man has only a niece left of his family. Fearing the nothingless that has begun to occupy their lives, they consciously choose to remove themselves from its grasp - the old man with his drinking, the older waiter with his attempt to "go home" despite knowing of his "insomnia". Hemmingway reveals the often painful ways we "cope on" with life, despite knowing that its meaning is ultimately limited and short.

### Observations

- The story is the story of the older waiter
- As the night goes on, the people are more and more cognizant that they are alone
- Persistent feeling of isolation/alienation
  - So they move towards the café, which is well-light
- The details are supplied to give you a feeling
  - The old man never spilled his drink and walked away with dignity - shows he's not doing it for pleasure, it's just a way to relieve his pain
  - Images of solitary existence
  - We move from 1 place to another place
- The 3 characters are a progression of age - young, middle age, and old
  - The more naïve you are, the more happy and sheltered you are
  - As you get older, you can't escape the eventual onset of loneliness
  - The experience of life is not a good one, all you can hope for is to learn
- Repetition of "nothing"
- The meaning of life grows less and less meaningful as one experiences more of life
- Familiarity of nothing

### Emotive Descriptions ("Show not tell")

Question: What specific quotes and descriptions help create and refine an idea and why? How do we make inferences from descriptions in the story?

- *"How do you know it was nothing? / He has plenty of money"*
  - Money is clearly not the reason he's despairing
- *"In the daytime the street was dusty, but at night the dew settled the dust..."*
- *"I don't want to look at him. I wish he would go home. He has no regard for those who must work."*
- *"I'm sleepy now. I never get into bed before 3 o'clock. He should have killed himself last week."*
- *"An old man is a nasty thing"*
  - Shows the arrogance and the annoyance of the younger waiter and perhaps his desperation to avoid a) talking about this subject and b) coming to terms or facing with the reality that life will lead to despair - it's almost as if he was saying "that nothingness is a nasty thing"
  - He is trying to escape the despair that life brings
- *"The old man looked from his glass across the square , then over at the waiters"*
  - The glance at the empty square shows his loneliness, as if he's waiting or expecting someone else to be there, and yet the only people he actually sees are the waiters
- *"You have no fear of going home before your usual hour?"*
  - The older waiter is asking whether the younger waiter would like to return to his wife if she might be cheating on him
    - Perhaps the older waiter returned home early one night and the same happened to him, which is why he is currently lonely
  - Ignorance is bliss; everything you thought was true would now not be true
  - **Key Theme: There are certainly things you don't want to know**
- *"It was a nothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was a nothing too."*
  - He does everything because he just doesn't want to feel lonely
  - In the Lord's prayer he replaces all of the important words with "nothing" because he is in despair - he has lost faith
