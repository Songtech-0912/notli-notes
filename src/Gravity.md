# Gravity

## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Gravity is the force that every mass in the Universe exerts on every other mass. It is given by:

$$
F = - G\frac{M_1M_2}{d^2}
$$

This means that:

- Gravity is _directly proportional_ to the masses of the objects, so if an object is twice as heavy, the force of gravity is twice as strong
- Gravity is _indirectly proportional_ to the _square_ of the distance separating two objects, so if an object is twice as far away, the force of gravity is one-forth as strong

We can generalize the gravitational force on Earth on every object is approximately $F_g = 10 M$ (e.g. if the object has mass 20 kg, the gravitational force exerted on the object is 200 N). This is because the Earth's gravitational field $10 \mathrm{\ N/kg}$ (approximately). However, note that this does not carry over to other planetary bodies, where we must use the law of universal gravitation instead.

### Why negative?

Because gravity is an **attractive** force, it has negative potential energy, except at an infinite distance (where it is zero). The negative sign denotes that we need to add energy _into_ the system to move the masses apart. The **more negative** the graviational potential energy, the **more energy** we need to put into the system to pull the two attracting objects apart. 

So when we add positive energy into a system, we cause the gravitational position energy to become _less_ negative (but it will still be a negative number). Only if we were to add infinite energy into the system, so that the masses become an infinite distance apart, will the gravitational potential energy become zero.
