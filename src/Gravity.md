# Gravity

## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Gravity is the force that every mass in the Universe exerts on every other mass. It is given by:

$$
F = - G\frac{M_1M_2}{d^2}
$$

This means that:

- Gravity is _directly proportional_ to the masses of the objects, so if an object is twice as heavy, the force of gravity is twice as strong
- Gravity is _indirectly proportional_ to the _square_ of the distance separating two objects, so if an object is twice as far away, the force of gravity is one-forth as strong

We can generalize the gravitational force on Earth on every object is approximately $10 M$ (e.g. if the object has mass 20 kg, the gravitational force exerted on the object is 200 N). This is because the Earth's gravitational field $10 \mathrm{\ N/kg}$ (approximately). However, note that this does not carry over to other planetary bodies, where we must use the law of universal gravitation instead.

### Why negative?

Gravitational potential energy is 0 at an infinite distance. As the distance increases, the magnitude of the GPE decreases, meaning it takes less work to pull the two masses apart.

Potential energy is energy that can _potentially_ be used.
