# Charge and electromagnetism

## Charge

* All objects are composed of atoms which have positively-charged protons and negatively-charged electrons
* Objects have a non-zero **charge** if they have an imbalance of protons and electrons
	* If they have more electrons than protons, they are **negatively-charged**
	* If they have more protons than electrons, they are **positively-charged**
	* If they have equal numbers of protons and electrons, they are **neutrally-charged**
* We can measure charge in Coulombs:
	* 1 electron has a charge equal to $-1.602 \cdot 10^{−19}$ coulombs
	* 1 proton has a charge equal to $+1.602 \cdot 10^{−19}$ coulombs
* Opposite charges attract, like charges repel
* You can only add or remove electrons; you cannot remove protons
* So changes of charge involve objects gaining or losing electrons (not protons)

## Electrostatic Force

* Coulomb's law allows us to calculate the force between two charged objects, where $k = 8.9 \cdot 10^9$ (Coulomb's constant), $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the respective charges of the objects, and $d$ is the distance between the objects:

$$
F = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{d^2}
$$

* Unlike gravity (which is purely attractive), the electrostatic force can be _both_ attractive and repulsive
* The electrostatic force is $10^{20}$ times more powerful than the gravitational force, but because objects repel as much as they attract, the repulsion balances the attraction
* So the net electrostatic force is usually much smaller than the gravitational force

## The electrostatic field

- The electrostatic field fills all of space, and interacts with charges to create the electrostatic force
- In every location the field has both a direction and a magnitude
- Charges change the field, and the field pushes on charges

## Electric potential energy

* Electric potential energy depends on the distance betweent he centers of the charges
* Negative if the charges attract, positive if the charges repel
* Zero when charges are infinite distance apart
* This is because you need to do positive work (put energy _into_ the system) to pull two attracting charges apart, and you need to do negative work (take energy _out of_ the system) to push two repulsing charges together
