# Economics

Economics is all about **choices**. The questions economics answers are:

- Why do we need to _make_ choices?
- How can we make the _right_ choices?

## Scarcity

The **basic economic problem** is that all resources are scarce.

A resource is scarce if there is not enough of it to fulfill human needs.

Scare resources come at an **opportunity cost**: what you give up to acquire or do something.

When a firm has an option to produce a certain quantity of two goods, $A$, and $B$, the opportunity cost is given by:

$$
C_{\Delta A} = \frac{\Delta B}{\Delta A}
$$

$$
C_{\Delta B} = \frac{1}{C_{\Delta A}}
$$

Where $C$ is the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of the good, $\Delta A$ is the change in production of Good A, and $\Delta B$ is the change in production of Good B.

Firms have limited resources and thus must decide on what goods (or services) to produce (or provide).

The **Production Possibilities Frontier** is a curve showcasing the combinations of goods (or services) that a firm can produce.

- Points _on_ the curve are maximising (making the best use of) all resources
- Points _inside_ the curve are inefficient
- Points _outside_ the curve are impossible

Using the production possibilities frontier, we can find the opportunity cost of making a certain quantity of each product.

Increasing the factors of production **shifts** the production possibilities frontier outward, as additional inputs create high production possibilities. The same is true vice-versa.

Changing character preferences does **not** change the production possibilities frontier, but there is a _movement_ of a point on the graph.

## Trade

**Trade** is an exchange of goods or services between individuals, groups, or countries.

Two groups should trade if one is **better** at making something than the other.

If one group has an **absolute advantage**, it can make _more_ of one product in a time period.

If one group has a **comparative advantage**, it can make one product _more efficiently_ - that is, it has a lower opportunity cost making that product.

Unless two trading parties have the same opportunity cost, each will have a comparative advantage in producing their specific good.

## Solving for comparative advantage

The opportunity cost would be the number of units of one product forgone in producing one more unit of the other product. We can caluclate it:

- For **input** problems (factors/inputs used): **other** value **under** (IOU)
- For **output** problems (product quantity made): **other** value **over** (OOO)

For output problems using "OOO", the opportunity cost of one product is the reciprocal of the opportunity cost of the other product.

We can also use the formula for opportunity cost we mentioned earlier:

$$
C_{\Delta A} = \frac{\Delta B}{\Delta A}, C_{\Delta B} = \frac{1}{C_{\Delta A}}
$$

## Consequences of comparative advantage

If one party has a comparative advantage in producing one good/service, and the other party has a comparative advantage in producing the other good/service, they should **specialize** and **trade**.

Trade benefits everyone in society because it allows everyone to consume outside of their production possibilities frontier. Even a country with an absolute advantage in producing all goods would still benefit from trade with other countries. Whereas, countries and individuals that attempt self-sufficiency (producing everything on their own) will end up poorer and having less.

However, for trade to be **mutually beneficial**, it has to be an amount between the opportunity costs of both parties. Each party must receive a good at a lower opportunity cost than producing the good on its own. In other terms, the quantity $Q_x$ of a good $x$ traded would be between party $A$ and party $B$'s opportunity cost for making one unit of that good:

$$
A_{C_x} < Q_x < B_{C_x}
$$

If we have a good $X$ is traded between party $A$ and $B$. The opportunity cost of producing 1 more unit of good $X$ for $A$ would be $A_{C_x}$, and the opportunity cost of producing 1 more unit of good $Y$ for $B$ would be $B_{C_x}$. The quantity traded would have to be between $A_{C_x}$ and $B_{C_x}$.

Trading like this allows both parties to enjoy **gains from trade**.

## Utility

**Utility** is the satisfaction derived from consuming a product. We measure utility in **utils**.

**Marginal utility** is the utility derived from consuming an **additional** product

As products are consumed, total utility increases at a decreasing rate, eventually becoming negative. This is the **law of diminishing marginal utility**.

The process of weighing the costs and benefits of consuming a product is called **marginal analysis**.

While utility is a very idealized model, it is used to show that rational people do make choices based on maximizing satisfaction.

## Maximising utility

1. Start by finding the marginal utility per dollar for each item
2. Starting at zero, decide what to buy next by identifying what will bring more marginal utility per dollar.
3. Repeat the previous step until the budget is extinguished.

## Assumptions of Market Analysis

We always have these assumptions when analyzing any market:

* There are numerous buyers and sellers

* The good being sold is nearly identical

* Prices and qualities are known or freely accessible, and both buyers and sellers have perfect economic knowledge

* The market is **perfectly competitive**; that is, the market price of a good cannot be controlled by any buyer or seller

* There are no barriers to market entry

Some markets in real life are close to perfect markets; take, for example, the market for fresh oranges. Others are very far from a perfect market; for instance, the market for commerical jetliners. However, in economics, we always assume a perfect market, regardless of the actual state of the market in real life.

## Demand

**Demand** is the amount of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase.

For instance, customers may be willing to buy 3 books for 20 dollars. Thus, the *demand* for books at a price of 20 dollars is 3 books.

The **law of demand** is that as the price of a good increases, its quantity demanded decreases. This can be visualized on a demand curve, like this one:

A **change in quantity demanded** is a move along the demand curve:

## Supply

**Supply** is the amount of a good that firms are willing and able to sell.

For instance, a publishing firm may be willing to sell 3 books for 20 dollars. Thus, the *supply* for books at a price of 20 dollars is 3 books.

The **law of supply** is that as the price of a good increases, its quantity supplied increases. This can be visualized on a supply curve, like this one:

![](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/ef1joFK4eoVX.png?o=1)

A **change in quantity supplied** is a move along the supply curve:

## Types of goods

* **Subtitutes** are goods where *increasing* the price of the first good causes consumers to buy less of the first good and more of the second good (e.g. pepsi and coke)

* **Complements** are goods where *increasing* the price of the first good _increases_ the demand of the first good and _decreases_ the demand of the second good (e.g. milk and cereal)

* **Normal goods** are goods consumers buy _more_ of if they gain more income

* **Inferior goods** are goods consumer buy _less_ of if they gain more income

## Shifting demand

Demand is determined by 5 factors, collectively called the **determinants of demand** (easily remembered with the acronym I-N-E-P-T):

* Income

* Number of buyers

* Expectations of buyers

* Prices of substitutes/complements

* Tastes of consumers

A **change** (or shift) in **demand** is a situation where the entire demand curve shifts as a result of a change in the determinants of demand. A decrease in demand is a leftward shift of the demand curve, and an increase is a rightward shift.

## Shifting supply

Supply is determined by 4 factors, collectively called the **determinants of supply** (easily remembered with the acronym N-I-T-E):

* Number of sellers

* Input prices

* Technology

* Expectations of sellers

A **change in supply** is a situation where the entire supply curve shifts as a result of a change in the determinants of supply.

## Supply and demand

When we combine a supply curve and a demand curve, we have a supply-demand curve:

![](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/WIpJo1YfAdww.png?o=1)

At the point where the quantity supplied is *equal* to the quantity demanded, we have the **economic equilibrium**. The price of the good at that point is the **equilibrium price**, and its associated quantity is the **equilibrium quantity**. A market is at its most efficient (maximising utility for everyone) when it is at equilibrium.

At prices above the equilibrum price, the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. Thus, we have a **surplus**. At prices below the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied. Thus, we have a **shortage**.

## Shifting supply and demand

When both supply and demand _increase_, we know (from drawing supply-demand graphs) that:

- The increase in supply by itself causes a **reduction in price** and an **increase in quantity**
- The increase in demand by itself causes an **increase in price** and an **increase in quantity**

Combined, this means that an increase in **both** supply and demand **must** cause quantity to rise. However, we can't be sure whether the price will increase or decrease without knowing how _much_ the curves shifted, as supply and demand have opposite effects on price.

When both the demand and supply curves shift, the curve that shifts by the larger magnitude determines the effect on the equilibrium.

Similarly, when both supply and demand _decrease_, we know (from drawing supply-demand graphs) that:

- The decrease in supply by itself causes an **increase in price** and a **decrease in quantity**
- The decrease in demand by itself causes a **decrease in price** and a **decrease in quantity**

Combined, this means that a decrease in **both** supply and demand **must** cause quantity to fall. However, again, we _can't_ be sure whether the price will increase or decrease, as supply and demand have opposite effects on price.

Thus, as a summary:

| What changes?  | What does it cause?           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| $S \uparrow$   | $\uparrow Q$ $\downarrow P$   |
| $D \uparrow$   | $\uparrow Q$ $\uparrow P$     |
| $S \downarrow$ | $\downarrow Q$ $\uparrow P$   |
| $D \downarrow$ | $\downarrow Q$ $\downarrow P$ |
