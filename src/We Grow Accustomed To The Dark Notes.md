William, Joseph, Ken, Andre, Jacky

* Ken - *"as they learn to see - ... something adjusts itself to Midnight"*
  * Speed and flow adjusting to the poem
  * Comical effect juxtaposed with a darker message
* Dramatic pauses created by capitalization and hyphens
* Inconsistent meter, line-broken structure, and freer rhyme scheme - naturally makes you feel discomfort

### Most powerful images/descriptions

**Identify and select what you think are the most powerful images or descriptions or ideas in the poem.  Briefly explain why.**

- "A Moment - We Uncertain step...For newness of the night" - the rawness of stepping into the unknown and uncertain

- "And so of larger - Darknesses - Those Evenings of the Brain" - what is within us can affect what we perceive - the "night" is what we imagine of our surroundings, surrounded by perpetual uncertainty, but only within our minds

## Comprehension Questions

**Q: What ideas and feelings emerge from the poem? What is the speaker’s attitude and response to her situation? How would you explain what this poem is about?**

A sense of transcendentalism seems to permeate the poem - it is used as a vehicle to explore the confines of the human condition in the simplified microcosm of a walk in the darkness. The attitude of the speaker slowly shifts from discomfort to grudging acceptance to finally an ease with oneself and almost complete comfort. We may interpret the poem as a reflection of the author’s own journey to come to terms with her difficult and darkness circumstances and with the process of becoming “accustomed” to the “darknesses” of life.

## Theme

This is a poem about personal darkness - a person feeling despair and loneliness. One of the key things about American literature is its exploration of **loneliness**. Our individualist and independent character also makes us alone.

You can't just live your life with abandonment and despair and not even try. The darkness of the light - loneliness - can viscerally affect us. The bravest face the same challenges and difficulty but they can ***adjust*** to it. We don't always see the solution at first but the solutions can slowly come to us.

## Analysis

- The speaker starts by leaving with a person who holds a light
- But at a certain point the person holding the light turns away
- When you walked away from being with someone else and the "light" disappears you're left on your own and you can't see clearly
- Line 2 *"When Light is put away"*
  - Loss of someone near you
  - A dream, idea, aspiration, or belief dying
  - Whatever we count on is suddenly not there, and we need to find our way without it
- Line 8 *"And meet the Road - erect -"*
  - We are extremely cautius
  - The hyphens are dramatics
- *"Those Evenings of the Brain -"*
  - Mental illnesses - the feeling of being overwhelmed
  - There is not a moon to disclose a sign
- *"The Bravest - grope a little - \ And sometimes hit a Tree"*
  - We find our way by having accidents - groping and hitting a tree
  - The character doesn't just stay silent and wait for the light to return
  - Instead, they are willing to encounter obstacles in order to find their way
- *"Or something in the sight / Adjusts itself to Midnight -"*
  - Life then becomes "almost" straight - not perfect but the best you can do in the circumstances

## Connections

**Connection between "Accustomed to the Dark" and "A Clean Well-Lighted Place"**

*The two works deal with comparable subject matter but handle it differently. How do you see the two pieces as similar? How do you see them as different? WHich one do you think is more successful in how it presents its problem and how it resovles it?*

Both deal with the themes of loneliness and despair, but while "A Clean Well-Lighted Place" reacts in a nihlist and pessimist manner, "Accustomed to the Dark" brings hope and assures us that we will find our own light in the darkness. In "Accustomed to the Dark", there is a way out of the loneliness; in "A Clean Well-Lighted Place", the ultimate ending is one of a bottomless pit of despair and meaning could never be found.

In "Accustomed to the Dark" we are told of a plan to cope of the issue - stay on the road, walk carefully, let your eyes adjust, and then you'll be okay. However, in "A Clean Well-Lighted Place" there is no solution but to (temporarily) wait out the problem in a clean well-lighted place (though you'll eventually need to go home anyways). Hemmingway presumes that we are predestined to fate; Dickinson does not. Hemmingway seeks out the clean well-lighted place; Dickinson seeks out a way to see in the dark.
