## Overview of the Constitution

### Bicameral Congress

* The United States Congress is the **lawmaking body** of the United States
* It's the first branch of government mentioned in the Constitution! (Article 1, Section 1)
  * *"All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a **Congress of the United States**..."*
* Congress is one of the 3 branches of the national government (we call it the *legislative branch*)
* It is also *bicameral* which means it has **two** houses\* (chambers):
  * The Senate, which is the upper house;
  * The House of Representatives, which is the lower house;
  * \*: We call these *houses* because legislatures are *housed* in debate rooms
* The **House Of Representatives** is involved with...
  * Requirements to serve in the House of Representatives are:
    * You are a minimum of 25 years old
    * You have been a US citizen for at least 7 years
    * You are a legal resident of the state you represent
  * Representation is determined by population
    * Vermont, North/South Dakota, Wyoming, and Alaska have 1 representative
    * California (the most populous state) has 52
  * The specific powers granted to the House of Representatives are:
    * *Impeaching* the president and other federal officials (but crucially **not** holding the trial for an impeached official)
      * Impeachment is the process of giving an official a criminal indictment (basically saying that they did something bad enough to require a criminal trial)
    * *Deciding presidential elections* if no candidate wins the majority of the electoral college (but this has almost never happened)
    * Starting any bill that aims to raise taxes (*"The Power of the Purse"*)
* The **Senate** is involved with...
  * Requirements to serve in the Senate are:
    * You are a minimum of 30 years old
    * You have been a US citizen for at least 9 years
    * You are a legal resident of the state you represent
  * Two senators are chosen from each state
  * The specific powers granted to the House of Representatives are:
    * Holding impeachment trials (but not starting the impeachment process)
    * Ratifying treaties (which requires a 2/3rd majority vote)
    * Confirming the appointment of executive officers (the *Confirmation Power*), such as:
      * Cabinet secretaries
      * Federal judges
* Both senators and representatives are elected by the people (so anyone can become either!)
* Why do we have 2 houses of the legislature with different powers?
  * Reason 1: The historical reason
    * When the Constitution was being drafted, large states and small states couldn't agree on how many legislators each state should be given
    * Large states would benefit if the number of legislators were chosen based on **population**, while small states would benefit if legislators were limited to the **same number per state**
    * So the compromise was to have both!
      * Representatives would be chosen based on a state's population - we call this **proportional representation**
      * Senators would need to be the same number per state - we call this **equal representation**
  * Reason 2: The practical reason
    * It was thought that one house of the legislature can limit the other
    * So it prevents the legislative branch (Congress) from having too much power in the three-branch system
    * Thus, dividing the legislature into two houses preserves the principle of the **separation of powers**
      * The upper house (senate) has longer terms and stricter requirements as senators were expected to act as custodians and were not tied to the changing whims of the people
      * The lower house (representatives) has shorter terms and less strict requirements as representatives were expected to be more responsive to their voters and more directly reflect the changing opinions of the people

### Separation of Powers & Checks and Balances

* The **executive branch** is the second branch of government mentioned in the Constitution (Article 2, Section 1)
  * *"The executive power shall be vested in a **president of the United States of America**"*
* The executive branch includes both the President, acting administration, and a number of federal executive departments
* The powers and obligations of the president are:
  * To preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
  * To carry out the laws of the United States
* The **judicial branch** is the third branch of government mentioned in the Constitution (Article 3, Section 1)
  * *"The executive power shall be vested in a **president of the United States of America**"*
* The judicial branch is also known as "the Courts" is responsible for interpreting the law
  * *"The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in **one supreme court** and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time **ordain and establish**"*
* The Framers of the Constitution deliberately implemented a series of checks on the powers of the different branches of government to keep them balanced
  * Each of the branches has the power to check (i.e. limit) the other two
  * The **legislative branch** was meant to prevent the president from becoming a tyrant and dictator like King George III, and to limit the **executive branch**
    * The power of impeachment allows Congress to remove the President from office
    * The powers of "advice and consent" allow Congress to reject the President's appointment of judges and officials
    * Congress also has the power to investigate executive activities and officers
    * If the President vetoes a law, Congress with a 2/3rd majority in both houses can override the veto
    * If the President wants to pass a law, Congress can refuse
    * Congress can refuse to appropriate funds for executive programs
  * The **legislative branch** also has the ability to limit the **judicial branch**
    * Congress has the power of impeaching judges
    * The Senate can reject judicial nominees before they become federal judges
    * Congress can add or take away courts to change the federal court system
    * Congress can also change the jurisdiction of federal courts
    * Congress can pass new laws that override the Supreme Court decisions (so long as the decisions aren't based on the Constitution)
    * Congress can propose Amendments to the Constitution which overrule federal court rulings
  * The **executive branch** has the ability to limit the **legislative branch**
    * The president can veto Congress's laws so that they don't go into effect (immediately)
    * The president can call Congress into a special session (but he/she can't make them pass new laws)
    * The president can carry out laws contrary to what Congress intended
    * The Vice President has the power to break ties in the Senate
  * The **executive branch** also has the ability to limit the **judicial branch**
    * The president has the power to nominate Supreme Court justices
    * The president also has the power to nominate federal court justices
    * The president can pardon people convicted by the courts, which cancels out their judgements
    * The president can also refuse to carry out court decisions
  * Last, the **judicial branch** has the ability to limit the **legislative branch**
    * The judiciary can declare laws passed by Congress unconstitutional
    * The Chief Justice presides over impeachment trials
  * The **judicial branch** also has the ability to limit the **executive branch**
    * The judiciary can declare executive actions unconstitutional
    * The judiciary issues warrants in federal crime cases and presides over Senate impeachments as well
* Essentially, the checks and balances system makes it more difficult for the government to act in ways that harm the acts and interests of the citizens, preventing a British-style centralized government tha could lead to tyranny

### Federalism

* The principle of **federalism** is the idea that power should be divided between the national government and individual states
* It is derived from the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution, which states that *"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are **reserved by it to the states respectively, or to the people**"*
* The idea is that the United States should be a federation of states under a *federal system*
  * The national government takes care of matters that affect all states, such as foreign relations, imports/exports, coinage, and building interstate/public infrastructure
  * States' governments take care of local matters such as property management, construction, business, and schools
  * There are two main "styles" of federalism throughout US history:
    * **Dual federalism** was the previous predominant form, and it set out strict rules for what the national government was in charge of, and what state governments were in charge of, making sure neither could interfere with the other
      * Under this system, state governments are much more powerful than the national government and had much broader jurisdiction
    * **Cooperative federalism** is the current form, and it originated with the New Deal based on a controversial interpretation Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution - *"To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the serveral states, and with the Indian tribes"*
      * This interpretation allowed for the regulation of business nationwide and led to a much more powerful national government
      * Additionally, it changed federalism so that now the national government encourages states and localities to pursue *nationally-defined goals* and to adopt complimentary policies
      * The federal government uses funds to make states do what it wants and withdraws those funds if the states refuse to coorperate
      * Additionally, the federal government sets up **regulations and rules** that the states must follow

### Elections

* Congressional elections are the most significant elections as they are the supposed to be the best way for the will of the people to mold the government
  * The House of Representatives holds elections as per Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution - *"The House of Representaive shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature"*
  * States typically have power to decide the electoral process for their representaives
  * The Senate holds elections where both senators are chosen by the entire state
  * Good candidates tend to have certain characteristics:
    * An unblemished record without past convictions or scandals
    * Idealistic ambitions and a strong sense of morality
    * The ability to finance a campaign (a source of money)
      * This is highly controversial as candidates can spend millions on campaigning
    * Being an incumbent in office (having previously been elected and now seeking re-election)
  * Due to being inherently tied to needing to be re-elected, senators and representaives alike often choose to act in ways that are contrary to the public good or popular support
  * This allows them to build their personal brand and help them to get re-elected
* Presidential elections

### The Bill of Rights

* The Bill of Rights was originally passed to calm fears that the Constitution would create a strong national government that would trample individual civil liberties
* It convinced the anti-federalists (those opposed to the Constitution and the precursors to the 19th-century Democrats) to eventually approve and pass the Constitution
  * It ensured that basic natural rights would be granted to citizens and could not be infringed by the national government
  * With it, it also enshrined the principle that compromise is a fundamental part of American government
