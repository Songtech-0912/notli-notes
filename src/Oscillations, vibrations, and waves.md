# Oscillations, vibrations, and waves

## Introduction

-   A coordinated movement of vibrating particles creates a **wave**
-   A wave moves by **propagating** through a **transmission medium** (the surrounding substance, which could be water, air, or a solid)
-   There are 2 main types of waves:
    -   **Transverse waves** are when particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation - this is the case for water waves, seismic shear waves, and electromagnetic (light) waves
    -   **Longitudinal waves** are when particles oscillate parallel to the direction of propagation - this is the case for sound waves and seismic pressure waves
-   We can also categorize waves as **mechanical** or **non-mechanical** based on how they travel:
    -   A mechanical wave is not capable of transmitting its energy through a vacuum - these include sound, water, and seismic waves
    -   A non-mechanical wave is capable of transmitting its energy through a vacuum - these include electromagnetic and gravitational waves

## Describing Waves

-   The **period** is the time it takes for **one cycle** to complete ($P = \frac{t}{\mathrm{cycles}}$), usually given in units of time (e.g. seconds or minutes)
-   The **frequency** is the number of cycles made per unit time, and is the _inverse reciprocal_ of the period $(F = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{\mathrm{cycles}}{t})$
-   One **Hertz** is equal to one cycle per second, and it is the standard unit of frequency
-   A wave can also be described with amplitude, phase shift, and vertical shift (see the [trig notes](https://songtech-0912.github.io/Exam-Reference-Sheets/pages/Trigonometry.html) to refresh your memory on those)
-   The magnitude of the **wavelength** is the same as the period
