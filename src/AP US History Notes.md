## Clash of Civilizations

> **Focus Question: What were the long-term consequences caused by the interaction of Native American, European, and African societies between the 15th and 18th centuries?**

### The diverse societies of Native America 

#### Background

Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 1500s, North America was populated by Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, they were not a unified group; rather, hundreds of seperate cultures and societies formed, many with distinct and oftentimes incompatible cultures.

#### Political Systems

* Often matriarchical societies 

* Powerful leaders typically controlled a disproportionate share of wealth

* Leaders redistributed wealth to prove their generosity and strengthen their authority

* Generosity was a mark of good leadership and sharing was essential

#### Economic Systems

* Rare and valuable objects (e.g. jasper, obsidian, seashells) were used for trade

* Different groups were vastly different in terms of wealth

* Wealth could be traded or given for diplomacy

* Wealth was also given away by the wealthy to relatives

#### Religious Systems

* Strong belief in **animism** - all living things had spiritual power

* Women's spiritual power was rooted in fertility 

    * Performed rituals for sustaining the life-giving earth

* Men's spiritual power was rooted in hunting and war

    * Rituals to acknowledge the power of guardian spirits
    
    * Animals must be killed "properly"
    
    * War was a crucial rite of passage
    
    * Success in hunting and war was considered a sign of sacred protection and power

### The diverse societies of Africa

#### Background

African societies had developed vast kingdoms and empires prior to European contact, and had long established extensive networks of trade. However, the hostile and arid Sahara desert kept African peoples apart, resulting in numerous isolated civilizations that each had unique systems of govenance and trade. 

#### Political Systems

* Numerous kingdoms ruled Africa prior to European conquest

* Many kingdoms controlled numerous more microstates

* Wars between kingdoms were commonplace

#### Economic Systems

* Trade routes across the Sahara linked West Africa with the Arab world

* Trade across the African heartland passed through river basin controlled by different kingdoms

* Gold was a frequently traded metal, owning to its abundance

* Slaves were also traded

* Later on, natives of Africa began to trade with Europians 

#### Religious Systems

* Some societies of Africa were Islamic 

* Most, however, were animists

* Divine kingship was a traditional custom

* Rituals to promote fertility were observed

* Ancestors were reverred and believed to be part of the spirit world

### The Age of Exploration and Early Modern Europe

The growing power of European kingdoms within the 14th and 15th centuries gave way to an age of European exploration.

#### Background

* Europe relied on **subsistence agriculture**

* Famine, disease and poverty afflicted the masses

* Traditions prevailed due to the unpredictability and harshness of life

* However, the **Renaissance** started a series of changes that lead to the rise of great empires in Europe 

#### Political Systems

* The growing role of commerence lead to the centralization of power

* This lead to the decline of the nobility and the rise of monarchs

* Though monarchies were most common, republican governments did appear (e.g. Venice)

* Nearly all societies were patriarchical

#### Economic Systems

* Merchants traded with Asia and the Near East 

* Powerful city-states such as Venice became hubs for trade

* Rich merchants often sponsored great artists and could challenge the power of monarchs

#### Religious Systems

* The teachings of the Catholic Church was divine law

* Holy wars of religion were fought for Christianity

* With the advent of the Reformation the Church's power began to crumble

* Different interpretations of the gospel began to emerge

* Religious rivalries would cause wars between European powers

### European exploration and conquest

The growth of commerence, along with European exploration and colonization in the new world, triggered a series of European conquests in the New World.

#### Background

* Portugese sailers reached the West African coast in 1435

* Italian merchants soon followed

* Portugal soon controlled the African slave trade

* European powers competed for control of trade routes

* King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain expanded their empire by sponsoring Columbus's voyages

#### Causes

* The increased power of the Ottoman Empire, which controlled inland routes to Asia

* The inventions of new sailing ships that could tack into the wind

* Claiming foreign lands becoming a matter of national pride for Europeans

* European powers' vastly superior weaponry compared to native populations of Africa and Europe 

#### Effects

* Former empires of the Americas were toppled

* Mass conversions of native peopulations to Christianity

* European diseases were introduced into the new world

* The New World's population dwindled by 666%

## Chapter Two: American Experiments

> **Focus Question: In what ways did a growing European presence in the 16th to 18th centurey shape the Americas and its Native Americans?**

### The Columbian Exchange

#### Background

* Spain set up tribute colonies in the Americas after the defeat of the Mayan and Aztec Empires

* These colonies produced enormous quantities of silver, which were traded for Chinese goods and spices

* Spanish settlers introduced Old World diseases (e.g. smallpox) to the Americas with deadly results for native inhabitants of the New World  

* Spanish institutions - such as the legal code and Catholicism - were transferred to the New World through its Colonies

#### Overview

* Europeans were greatly interested in accessing the enormous wealth and populations of the Americas

* Europeans began to migrate to the Americas, along with their plants, animals, and diseases

* In return, European colonists in the Americas introduced new plants and animals to Europe and Asia

* The movement of plants, animals, and diseases between Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas became known as the **Columbian Exchange**

#### Effects

* Native societies of the Americas were weakened and sometimes driven to extinction

* Christianity was introduced and became the main religion of the Americas

* A mixed racial system and hierarchy developed in the Americas

* European, African and Native American cultures mixed to form a new culture

### Plantation Colonies and Slavery

#### Background

* Overspending by Spain caused massive inflation and ruined the Spanish economy

* Spain gradually lost control of its monopoly on American trade

* Other European nations began to establish their own colonies in the Americas

* Worldwide demand for cash crops - such as sugar and tobacco - caused the development of plantation colonies

#### Overview

* The Portugese created sugar plantations on the Brazilian coast

* Due to labor shortage, African slaves were used as labourers

* The English started highly profitable tobacco plantations in New England

* Royal colonies each had an appointed governor, elected assembly, legal code, and Anglican clergy

### Effects

* As tobacco was a land-intensive crop, English settlers pushed further and further into Native Americans' territory

* Disagreements about who should pay tribute caused tensions to rise between European settlers and Native Americans 

* Eventually, tensions sparked war in 1622, causing a decade of ruinous war

* A mass migration of African slaves to the Americas, which displaced the native population 

### Plantations in the Caribbeans

#### Background

* French and English colonists began to colonize the Carribean islands 

* The colonized islands were exploited for sugar production

* Rich landowners seized land and created sugar plantations 

#### Overview

* Sugar cane was grown on huge plots of land

* Laborers for the plantations were initially **indentured servants** who had immigrated from Europe

* Later, enslaved Africans, who could produce cash crops more cheaply, replaced the indentured servants

* Tighter restrictions on African slaves meant that more and more slaves became lifelong servants

#### Effects

* Social mobility for African slaves reduced

* All Africans began to become regarded as slaves

* **Chattel slavery** became more and more commonplace

### Neo-European Colonies

#### Background

* The French, Dutch and English settled the Northeast and built colonies

#### Overview

* New France, based around Quebec, became a center of fur trading and missionary work

* New Netherland, based around New Amsterdam (today New York), also started trading fur with the Native Americans 

* Relations with the Native Americans were oftentimes rough, especially due to European efforts of religious conversion

#### Consequences

* The Dutch-supported Iroquois Confederacy launched a series of attacks on the French-supported Alqonquians, causing all-out war between the Iroquois and New France

* English settlers, allied with the Iroquois, took over New Netherland 

* English presence in New England continued to grow and English influence would begin to eclipse French and Dutch influence

### The Puritans of New England

#### Background

* King Charles I of England was accused of allying with Catholicism

* He issued a purge of dissidents, including many **Puritans**

* Many Puritan families fled to the New World, where they formed many self-sufficient communities

#### Overview

* In England, Puritans in parliament gained power and overthrew the monarchy

* However, the monarchy was later restored, and the Puritans were forced into exile

* Many Puritans fled to the New World after their defeat 

* Puritans established churches, elected govenors, and created assemblies of colonists tasked with govening the colonies

#### Effects

* Many Puritans were part of the Revolution, and continued to uphold their republican ideals within their colonies

* The widespread distribution of land and self-govenance of the pilgrims ensured that their colonies would be long-lasting

* As it expanded, new England became a new world of opportunity

* Colonial societies pressured Native Americans to accept new claims to power and new figures of authority

* Contested claims of authority often resulted in war, such as with the Pequots in 1636 and the Wampanoag in 1675

### Sample Questions and Answers


**Q1: What motivated English settlement of Jamestown and New England and how are those colonies impacted by their geography? To what extent could you make the case that the dual civilization theory goes back to settlement?**

- The settlement of Jamestown was motivated by the lucrative tobacco industry that was booming in the New World. While other crops grew poorly, tobacco thrived on the Virginian soil. This led to the development of indentured servitude in the Jamestown colony, in which young men from mainland Britain would brave the voyage to Virginia in hopes of striking a profit off of the tobacco business

- The settlement of New England was motivated by the desire among Puritan exiles to create a new home and base for their religious beliefs to be spread freely. Due to the poor weather conditions and poor soil, crops could not be grown to any scale more than subsistence farming, and this lead to the North not being as dependent as agricultural profits to sustain the colonies

**Q2: Choose two of the following and analyze their impact on colonial North American development between 1620 and 1776: Puritanism, the Enlightenment, the 1st Great Awakening.**

- Puritanism was instrumental in paving the way for a religiously ordained society in English new world settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries. Firstly, the practice of strict obedience to church was crucial in sustaining a unified society and bridging the divides of occupation and social class. Secondly, the Puritan identity, which sought to distinguish itself from the Anglican identity in the homes of religious purism, became more and more detached from the traditions and rule of Britain, ultimately paving the way for independence.

- The Enlightenment made a major impact on the development of colonial North America as it laid the groundwork for the ideals of federalism, rule of law, and inviolable universal rights, which, among others, would influence the development of religious tolerance, democratic participation, and relative free speech within. The Englightenment ideal of nationalism and of the nation-state also stipulated that the people had the right for indepedence when their governments had grown overly oppressive, which paved the way for the revolutionary movement

**Q3: Discuss the differences between the northern, middle, and southern English colonies. How do you account for those differences?**

- Firstly, the northern colonies were demographically more diverse, with entire families immigrating to New England, which allowed the area to have a stable population and crucially not be dependent on slave labor for sustenance. The colony was composed of family units, and power was controlled via religious leaders (pastors), and was heavily based on conformity.

- In contrast, the middle colonies were composed of mostly men, and conditions were poor, causing the enslavement of Native Americans, indentured servants, and lastly African slaves to simply provide enough labor to man the farms

- Lastly, the southern English colonies were primarily geared towards large-scale agriculture, including cotton, indigo, and rice. Charlestown's slave trade made it very powerful and wealthy, making it a buffer colony between the Native Americans of Florida and the settlements of Virginia

**Q4: Compare the ways in which TWO of the following reflected tensions in colonial society: Bacon's Rebellion (1676), Pueblo Revolt (1680), Salem Witch Trials (1692), Stono Rebellion (1739).**

- The Salem Witch trials revealed that any colonist daring to stray out of line could be vulnerable to persecution. Hysteria also lead to societies acting out of fear.

- Bacon's Rebellion proved that discontent towards authorities and the House of Burgesses was commonplace among the colonies, and power struggles were easily caused by the consolidation of power in one person. Additionally, the aftermath of Bacon's Rebellion was a mass campaign of "divide and conquer" by the colonial governors via the slave codes, which was successful in preventing any former slaves from uniting togehter. Lastly, the poor that were involved with the rebellion began their dismay with "taxation without representation".

### Sample Questions and Answers

**Q1: Analyze the effect of the French and Indian War and its aftermath on the relationship between Great Britain and the British colonies.  Confine your response to the period from 1754 to 1776.**

First, the French and Indian War convinced nearly all British colonists in the British colonies of America to abandon all efforts towards converting the Native Americans, and to use force from that point on in driving them off their land. Second, it greatly doubled British debt, which was already rising, causing the royal treasuring to resort to increasingly aggressive measures to make up for the financial losses. Last, and perhaps most importantly, it signalled to the colonists that the British were their overlords and restrained them from further conquest against the Native American territories, which would lead to rebellions breaking out in the colonies. These rebellions resulted in the Intolerable Acts, which ultimately drove the colonies to revolution.

**Q2: Analyze the political, diplomatic, and military reasons for the United States victory in the Revolutionary War. Confine your answer to the period 1775-1783.**

Politically, the increasing pressure on Lord North to end the war in Britain prevented him from devoting more forces, and Lord North’s coercive tactics to bring the colonists back into line also hardened the American opposition. Diplomatically, the support of the French played a major role in keeping the British at bay, and Prussian training for American troops greatly bolstered their abilities. Militarily, the familiarity with the land and the fact that the Americans were fighting a defensive war played to their advantage.

**Q3: Analyze the ways in which the political, economic, and diplomatic crises of the 1780s shaped the provisions of the United States Constitution.**

The Panic of 1785 made it clear that the debts accumulated by the military for independence could not continue for too long, and that there was no unified force that could prevent such a panic in the future. This also lead to a demand for a stronger federal government and a national bank, which would begin to rise under James Madison.

**Q4: Settlers in the 18th-century American backcountry sometimes resorted to violent protest to express their grievances. Analyze the causes and significance of TWO of the following: March of the Paxton Boys, Regular movement, Shays’ Rebellion, Whiskey Rebellion.**

Shays’ Rebellion proved that unequal taxation measures could still lead to conflict, but also that, in Jefferson’s words (roughly) “an occasional rebellion is sometimes good for preserving a democracy”. Additionally, it exposed the failures of the Articles of Confederation in that no national force could be mobilized to stop the revolt, and that local militias had to be recruited instead, leading to the 2nd amendment and the Constitution instead. In contrast, the Whiskey Rebellion some ten years later made clear that the federal government was sufficiently united and determined to be able to stop a revolt such as Shays’ Rebellion. Washington’s response also strengthened national unity, as his two-pronged approach of both using diplomacy and using military force was able to stop the revolt without major consequences.

  - Mormonism-Joseph Smith (given the book of Mormon from an angel) later killed by an angry mob and Brigham Young (west to Utah)
    - Significant because it fostered nationalism (see this in the Hudson River School Art) and because it helped to spark the reform movements of the 1830s and 1840s

  - Prison/Treatment of the Mentally Ill
    - Key activist: Dorothea Dix

## US Involvement in WW I

### Background of WWI

- (Triple Aliance is Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy; Triple Entente is Britain, France, Russia; June 1914 assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne led the alliances into war; Russia tied to Serbs; Germany to Austria-Hungary; new technology made this the deadliest war to date; long-range high-velocity rifles; millions of soldiers fought in trenches on the Western Front; Germans used poison gas; hundreds of thousands died with no movement of the front line.)
- Old tactics with new technology
- Started as a dispute between Austro-Hungary and Serbia
- Later the Serbians pulled the Russians in (because of their secret alliances)
- The Austro-Hungarians pulled in Germany (because of their secret alliances)
- Devastating war because of deadly new weapons and obselete life-costing tactics

### American Neutrality

- President Wilson tries to keep Americans out of the war to influence postwar settlement

  - Sinking of the _Lusitania_ ocean liner carrying American passengers to British, causing public outrage

Mandates - Central Powers' colonies in Africa were dismantled and assigned as mandates instead of being granted freedom; British mandate in Palestine (now Israel) led to thousands of Jews moving there for land; riots between Palestinians and Jews occurred as early as 1920; Wilson suggested a League of Nations.
  - Congress Rejects the Treaty Debate
  - Republican Party was openly hostile toward treaty and toward continued U.S. involvement in world affairs; Not invited to Paris by Wilson Wilson traveled extensively to convince people to support treaty; suffered a stroke in September 1919; treaty failed. Failure Wilson's health never recovered fully; United States did not ratify treaty or join League of Nations--DID NOT want to lose the power to declare war by entering a permanent alliance; emerged from the war a world power.

## Civil Rights Movement

### Context

### The Kennedy Administration

* Dr. King
  * Will finish this later...
* Malcolm X
  * Had a very difficult childhood
  * Joined the Nation of Islam

* The Treaty of Geneva in 1954 ended the French Indochina War and split the country into North Vietnam, controlled by Vietnamese communists *(the Viet Minh)*, and South Vietnam, controlled by Vietnamese nationalists *(the Viet Nam)*
* Fighting between the two sides began to break out almost immediately afterwards, as both governments asserted themselves as the sole legitimate government of Vietnam
* Alleged North Vietnamese attacks on US naval warships in the Gulf of Tonkin started US forces into the war
  * They were not real attacks
  * But they were highly publicized and inspired nationalistic fervor (like 100 years ago in *remember the USS Maine*)
  * Johnson passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution unanimously - allow US action to protect themselves from attack under "whatever force necessary"
  * However, because the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was not a declaration of war, it had no restrictions on what LBJ could do with it
* LBJ escalates the war
  * Brutality
  * Bombings
  * Chemicl defoiliation, napalm
  * Search and destroy missions

* Nixon and Vietnamization
  * Silent majority - non-vocal group representing the majority of anti-counterculture white middle-class Americans who were increasingly ignored - allowed Nixon got elected - he campaigned for end of Vietnam War
  * Ho Chi Minh Trail - Viet Cong escaped to Cambodia
  * Nixon decided to bomb Cambodia as a result - Christmas Bombings
  * Massive public outrage
  * Vietnam was the first *telivized war* - allowed people to form their opinions of what they were seeing e.g. My Lai massacre
  * Federal government tries to mislead people with the Pentagon Papers - told civilians one thing, actually did something else entirely different
  * High mistrust of government
  * 1975: US defeated, 58,000 soldiers are killed, and 365,000 Americans were wounded
  * Americans didn't welcome home the vets warmly and spat on them; many had PTSD and were not recognized for their services
* **Key takeaway:** Unlike the Korean War, which the US ended with a stalemate (and so technically *didn't* lose!), the Vietnam War was a complete defeat which made the war a national embarrasment far more than the Korean War

  * Phillips felt Americans had had enough of New Deal liberalism and elitism (based in the Northeast)
  * New conservative majority could be formed with Catholics, white Southerners, Sun Belt (old South and Texas, CA, NM, OK, AZ), and average middle class Americans. To borrow a ternm from the 1920s, they sought a "return to normalcy"

  * Presidents were now required to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing troops
  * If forces are launched without Congressional approval, the Act gave a 90 day window for the president to direct troops, of which the last 30 days were required to withdraw forces
  * Essentially a "check" on the executive branch's power (presidency)

### Important Reminders

- Make sure you read the question **carefully**! Students can often mess up time periods!
  - For instance, the "19th century" is NOT the same as the 1900s!
Note - On SAQs (Short Answer Questions)
  - Answer format should be in Topic Sentence - Evidence - Analysis format
  - **Topic Sentence**
  - Answer the prompt in a clear, declarative sentence
  - **Evidence**
  - Name a piece of specific historical evidence, and explain
  - **Analysis**
  - Demonstrate how your evidence proves your topic sentence
- Exemplar: *Briefly describe ONE specific historical difference between the internal migration patterns within the United States in the period of 1910-1940 and the internal migration patterns in the period of 1941-1980*
  - **Topic Sentence**
  - One major difference with respect to internal migration between the two periods is the direction of the movement.
  - **Evidence**
  - For example, the Great Migration began in 1916 and from 1941-1980 there was a large migration to the Sunbelt States.
  - **Analysis**
  - The Great Migration was the movement of black southerners out of the South and into the Northeast and Midwest states for better living and working conditions, but the Sunbelt migration involved people from the North moving to the West, in many cases for jobs in the defense industry.
