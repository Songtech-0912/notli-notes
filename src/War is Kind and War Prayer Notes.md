## Shared Observations

### War is Kind

* "War is kind" is repeated like a battle cry though it is so ironic because war is obviously not kind
* Repetition creates the sense that the emotions are being held back for the sake of continuing the pretense that "war is kind"
* Use of emotive language adds to a continued metaphor of the reality vs. the propaganda of war
* The odd passages (in italics) are like the "propaganda posters" which exclaim the glories of war, while the even passages are like the "consolation letters" from the military to those who have lost loved ones in war - but they do not offer true consolation, but instead repeat the absurd idea that "War is Kind", thereby showing the shallowness of the emotion they wish to convey
* Satirical imagery
* Juxtaposition - *War is kind* is indented and typography distinguishes the plain and italic stanzas
* Based on context we infer that war is not kind:
  * Crane decides to repeat *War is Kind* because it's an ironic reflection of war
    * "The excellence of killing" - killing is not excellent
    * "Virtue of slaughter" - slaughter is not virtuous
  * Irony is when language is used in a manner opposite of its intended meaning
  * Crane creates a tone by showing of all the ways that war is incredibly unkind
    * "War is kind" used in this way is more powerful than simply calling the poem "War is unkind"
    * The plain-form stanzas addresses a different female character as if a consolation letter
      * The tone of the stanzas are somewhat patronizing by the shallow consolation of "war is kind" - that's like saying "get over it!"
      * Because each consolation does a terrible job of convincing their subjects that "war is kind", as their imagery and description betrays this message and tells the opposite story
    * The italicized stanzas seem like war recruitment posters or propoganda about war
      * The italicized passages are hyper-patriotic imagery - an inflated sense of patriotism that shows
      * The stanzas are stiffer, firmer, more bold, to the point that the language almost ignores the poignant and sad
  * Mood is the *feeling* of a piece, while *tone* is the author's attitude towards the piece, as reflected through the writing - this has to be interpreted by the reader!
    * E.g. "His suit was the best part about him" - obviously, this person is not described in flattering terms
* The repeated use of euphenism to convey a false sense of glory
* Repetition
  * The refrain of "War is kind" reinforces the idea that war is definitely unkind, and every time it is said it becomes more unconvincing
  * *"These men were born to drill and die"* - makes it seem that the soldiers are disposable
  * *"A field where a thousand corpses lie"* - there is a lot of dead people

### War Prayer

* The people are so blinded by their conviction that they choose to voluntarily forget the dark horrors of actual war
* Their conviction paints a picture of war through rose-tinted glasses, one that the messanger shatters with the actual truth
* No one is praying for the end quickly and the violence to end!
* Religious preachers are being hypocrites for preaching the love of God while also being strong proponents for bloody and violent conflict
* The first paragraph is an unbroken run-on sentence that has very few breaks
  * *"It was indeed a glad and gracious time"*
  * *"No, it is two - one uttered, and the other not"*
* *"When you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory - must follow it, cannot help but follow it"* - do you realize what you are also praying for when you are praying for glory?
* The war prayer sheds all the glory of war and makes it clear the chilling costs of war and "collateral damage" caused by war, especially onto innocents
  * He is saying "do you still want it?"
  * But they dismiss it because they don't even want to think about it

## Analysis of both poems

**War is Kind: Anti-war message**

In "War is Kind", Stephen Crane highlights the hypocrisy of those who advocate for warfare and exposes the actual reality of war. By claiming "war is kind" repetitively despite numerous contradictions, he expertly contrasts the glorious view of war presented by the authorities in comparison with its heinous actual nature. He contrasts the "lover [who] threw wild hands toward the sky" with supposed greatness of "a field where a thousand corpses lie. The senseless and meaningless deaths of the young soldiers are thus explained away as simply one corpse of a thousand by the authorities, who even try to claim that a battlefield strewn with corpses would be "great". By doing so, Crane shows his immense dissatisfaction with the manner in which delusion and propaganda have lured young men into believing that "war is kind", and criticizes how such authorities have selfishly convinced them to give up their lives.

**War prayer: anti-war message as well**

In "War Prayer", Twain exposes the blind patriotic and religious fervor that has lead to the carnage of war. Twain first describes the seemingly benign prayer of war - one which ushers for divine protection and seeks for God to "aid, comfort, and encourage them in their patriotic work". But ironically, the fine language and beautiful lines of this prayer are interrupted by a second prayer: one of bloodlust and greed in which he asks for the enemy soldiers to be "torn to shreds by our shells" and to "drown the thunder of the guns with shrieks of the wounded". Twain then describes the actual war, showing that the second prayer was one that ultimately manifested itself on the battlefield. He reveals that the praises and idealized prayers of those who go to war were a false reflection of its actual nature. In doing so, Twain shows how ignorance has blinded us to ask for glory and triumph, and conceal us the inner desire to cause bloodshed and terror. He shows that the refusal to admit these negative passions has done nothing but continue to perpetuate a false nature of war.
