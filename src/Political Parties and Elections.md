# Political Parties and Elections

## Types of Electoral Systems

- **Single-member districts** - one representative per district
	- Advantage: simple, clear-cut
	- Disadvantage: tends to skew towards two-party system
- **Proportional representation** - number of representatives based on the size of districts (larger districts get more representatives, smaller districts get less)
	- Advantage: improves representation and fosters multi-party system
	- Disadvantage: nebulous, unclear
- **First-past-the-post voting** - voters cast their vote for a candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins (even if the top candidate gets less than 50%)
