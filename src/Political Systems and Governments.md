# Political Systems, Regimes, and Governments

## Before starting...

* Keep an open mind before doing AP comparative gov
* Remember that there are multiple sides to a story, and there is a danger to telling a singular story
* Don't be too pessimistic! There are stories of success in the stories of failure!
* This is a course on distinct nations, but don't forget that whatever the state of these countries

## Classifying nations

* Several measurements can be used to measure the growth and development of nations, including:
	* **Human development index** (HDI) - economic and social
	* **Freedom house score** (FH) - political
* Factors used in evaluation
	* Electoral process
	* Political participation
	* Functioning of government (fiscal responsibility, regulatory efforts, open markets, transparency or corruption)
	* Freedom of Expression and Belief
	* Association/Organization Rights
	* Rule of Law
* Examples:

| Nation | [Human Development Index (HDI)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) | [GDP/GDP per Capita/Gini ](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) | [Freedom Score](https://freedomhouse.org/) | 
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| United Kingdom | .932 (rank 13) democratic government | 40,284.64 USD per capita Gini: 73.2% 2.7 trillion | 78.4 / 100 7th - score improved when regional gov't of Northern Ireland resumed treaty in 2020 - finalized EU departure | 
| Nigeria | .539 | GDP: 432.3 billion USD $ 2,562.19 per capita | 45/100 |
| Mexico | .779 | $2.3 trillion, Decreased .3%, AND $17,000 per capita | 60/100 | 
| Russia | HDI: .824 (High Human Development Category) Ranked 52nd out of 189 countries and territories 12.1% increase from 1990 to 2019 (.735 - .834) | Raw GDP: $4.328 trillion (6th), Per capita: $29,485 (55th), Gini: 40.9% | 20/100 (144th) |
| Iran | .783 | GPD 191.7 billion USD Per capita 6,980.74 | 16/100 | 
| China | .761 | GDP $14.72 trillion USD Per capita $9,020.00 | 9/100 |

### Development and economic liberalization 

Transition to less government involvement in economy

## Supranational organization

* Globalization and international organization
* E.g. NATO, EU, UN, OPEC
* Give up national sovereignty
* Foreign Direct Investment - how much does a country's economy depend on foreign investment

## What characterizes democracies?

| Elements of democracy | Elements not necessarily of democracy |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Cooperation e.g. peaceful transition of power | Free/open/unregulated markets | 
| Free (i.e. no intimidation) and fair (i.e. no fraud) elections | Arbritrary regular elections | 
| Open public realm and public forum | Social safety net/civil society/government help |
| Representatives listen to their constituents | Efficient government |
| Majoritan rule with protection of minorities | High rate of development |

### Terms

* **Political systems** comprise the laws, ideas, and procedures that decide what government is and what government does
* **States** are political institutions that combine a permanent population with governing institutiotns that exercise control over an internationally-recognized territory
* A **nation** is a non-concrete group formed by people with common identities
	* A state _can_ have a national identity, but there are nations that are not a state, and states can include multiple nations
* A **regime** is the fundamental rules decide how power exercises
	* Regime change is a change in the style of the government
* **Government** is the set of institutions or individuals legally empowered to make binding decisions for a state
* **Sovereignty** is the right to self-rule

### A study of political systems

* China's political system is an **authoritarian regime**
* Iran's political systems is a **theocracy** with semi-democratic elements
* Nigeria's political system has existed as a constitutional presidential democracy with a federal system since 1999
* Mexico's political system has existed as a constitutional presidential democracy since 1917
* Russia's political system is theoretically a federalist democracy but has authoritarian elements
* The UK is technically a constitutional monarchy but a democracy in practice, with no separation of power

### Nations vs. States

#### Addressing nations and ethnic minorities

* Countries can deal with nationalist movements and separatist movements in several ways
* War/suppression of dissent/violence/ethnic cleansing
* Assimilation
* Vote/referendum on independence
* Devolution/granting partial autonomy/federalism
* Allow for self-rule/representation

## Democracy

### Terms

* **Democracy** or **authoritarianism** of states can be determined by:
	* Rule of law - is the state governed by law or by arbritrary decree?
	* **Government transparency** - do the citizens know what the government is doing? 
	* **Free and fair elections** - are elections competitive and opposition parties able to have a chance?
	* **Independence of government branches** - is one branch able to control all government power?
* Types of democracy
	* **Consolidated democracies** are fully democratic and have established democracies in such a way that they are unlikely to become undemocratic
	* **Transitional democracies** are democratic but still need democratic improvement
	* **Hybrid regimes** have some democratic elements but are generally undemocratic
	* **Iliberal democracies** and **hybrid regimes** are states that hold elections from time to time with little competition toward the ruling party
	* **One party states** prevent any other party from competing in elections
	* **Theocracies** require the state be controlled by leaders of a particular religion (Iran)
	* **Totalitarian governments** severely limit citizensâ€™ rights to movement and free choice of employment
	* **Military regimes** are when military leaders hold top positions of governing authority (common in Nigeria from independence through 1999 constitution)

## Power, Authority, and Legitimacy

* **Power** is the ability of someone to make other(s) do something
	* Can be negative e.g. by intimidation, bribery or positive e.g. by respect, popularity
* **Authority** is the right for someone to do something
* **Legitimacy** is when the people feel the government has a right to use power in the way they do
	* Legitimacy can increase the power of a regime and government
	* Restoring legitimacy in a country is a primary objective of a country's leaders

### Sources of Power and Authority

* Some countries base their power and authority from a Constitution and the consent of the governed (e.g. holding popular elections)
* Others base their power from different means:
	* Endorsement of the dominant political party - e.g. China, Russia
	* Religion - e.g. Iran
	* The military - e.g. Nigeria
	* Nationalism - e.g. Russia
	* Tradition and institution - e.g. the UK
	* Government effectiveness and economic growth - e.g. 1970s China
* The more tumultuous a country's history, the more likely a country is to favor strong (and possibly authoritarian) leaders
* Transitions of power can affect power and authority
	* Peaceful transitions of power e.g. in elections
	* The political elite's backing of a strong president in Russia, creating a "managed democracy" with election rules favoring one party
	* The UK's constitutional reforms and devolution to allow local and regional parliaments to hold some amount of power
	* Coup/coup d'etat: a forcible takeover of governing power
	* Revolution: the removal and long-term replacement of a form of government, e.g. in Mexico (1910), Russia (1917), China (1949), Iran (1979)

### Sustaining Legitimacy

* Asserting power abroad (e.g. Russia posting troops near Ukraine, US invading Iraq, etc.)
* Holding popular elections
* Governmental effectiveness
* Economic growth
* The endorsement
* Religious/nationalist heritage

### Specific sources of legitimacy for countries

| Country | Source of Legitimacy |
|---------|-----------------------|
| China | Popular revolution, tradition, economic growth, nationalism |
| Iran | Popular revolution, Shia Islam | 
| Mexico | Popular revoluion, Constitution, popular elections |
| Nigeria | Independence, Constitution, popular elections |
| Russia | Nationalism |
| UK | Tradition, stability, popular elections |


### Challenges to Legitimacy

* Increase in corruption, reduced electoral competition
* Serious problems (economic issues, social conflicts, terrorism, natural disasters) and _especially_ mismanaged responses to crises

## Devolution

* Devolution is the **spreading out of power** to regional governments
* This is a double-edged sword:
	* Can promote policy innovation and allow policies to match local needs, increasing legitimacy
	* Can also introduce contradictory policy or perpetuate inequality, decreasing legitimacy

### Federal States

* Federal states constitutionally divide power among different levels of government (federalism) to confer a degree of local autonomy
* But they also reserve some powers for the national government
* Examples: Mexico, Nigeria, Russia

#### Mexican Federalism

* 32 states including Mexico City
* Strong central government
* Policies (e.g. legal status of abortion) can vary between states

#### Nigerian Federalism

* 36 states
* Also strong central government
* 12 northern states are very rural and Muslim
* But these states are also where oil is located

### Unitary States

* Concentrate power at the national level, with more uniform policies and potentially more efficient policy-making
	* Districts have functions but do not have policy-making ability
* E.g. China, Iran, the UK
* Unitary doesn't necessarily mean authoritarian
* (The UK has no constitutional guarantee of devolving power to regional governments, that's why we consider it unitary)

### Changes in Allocations of Power

* Although Russia's constitution establishes federalism with protected powers of regional governments, Putin has centralized power in the name of national security
	* Why does Putin do this?
	* Because its eastern regions (Chechnya) who are fighting for independence are also its most oil-rich regions, and essential to the Russian economy
	* And bolstering the economy gives the Russian central government (and Putin) legitimacy and power
* China is a unitary government but has autonomous regions (Tibet and Xinjian) and constitutional protections of ethnic minorities but the central government maintains its sovereignty in those regions
* China also has special administrative regions (SARs) in Hong Kong and Macau which gives both significant political autonomy
