# Political Systems, Regimes, and Governments

## Before starting...

* Keep an open mind before doing AP comparative gov
* Remember that there are multiple sides to a story, and there is a danger to telling a singular story
* Don't be too pessimistic! There are stories of success in the stories of failure!
* This is a course on distinct nations, but don't forget that whatever the state of these countries

## Classifying nations

* Several measurements can be used to measure the growth and development of nations, including:
	* **Human development index** (HDI) - economic and social
	* **Freedom house score** (FH) - political
* Factors used in evaluation
	* Electoral process
	* Political participation
	* Functioning of government (fiscal responsibility, regulatory efforts, open markets, transparency or corruption)
	* Freedom of Expression and Belief
	* Association/Organization Rights
	* Rule of Law
* Examples:

| Nation | [Human Development Index (HDI)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) | [GDP/GDP per Capita/Gini ](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) | [Freedom Score](https://freedomhouse.org/) | 
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| United Kingdom | .932 (rank 13) democratic government | 40,284.64 USD per capita Gini: 73.2% 2.7 trillion | 78.4 / 100 7th - score improved when regional gov't of Northern Ireland resumed treaty in 2020 - finalized EU departure |

	* Rule of law - is the state governed by law or by arbritrary decree?
	* **Government transparency** - do the citizens know what the government is doing? 
	* **Free and fair elections** - are elections competitive and opposition parties able to have a chance?
	* **Independence of government branches** - is one branch able to control all government power?
* Types of democracy
	* **Consolidated democracies** are fully democratic and have established democracies in such a way that they are unlikely to become undemocratic
	* **Transitional democracies** are democratic but still need democratic improvement
	* **Hybrid regimes** have some democratic elements but are generally undemocratic
	* **Iliberal democracies** and **hybrid regimes** are states that hold elections from time to time with little competition toward the ruling party
	* **One party states** prevent any other party from competing in elections
	* **Theocracies** require the state be controlled by leaders of a particular religion (Iran)
	* **Totalitarian governments** severely limit citizensâ€™ rights to movement and free choice of employment
