# Political Systems, Regimes, and Governments

## Before starting...

* Keep an open mind before doing AP comparative gov
* Remember that there are multiple sides to a story, and there is a danger to telling a singular story
* Don't be too pessimistic! There are stories of success in the stories of failure!
* This is a course on distinct nations, but don't forget that whatever the state of these countries

## Classifying nations

* Several measurements can be used to measure the growth and development of nations, including:
	* **Human development index** (HDI) - economic and social
	* **Freedom house score** (FH) - political
* Factors used in evaluation
	* Electoral process
	* Political participation
	* Functioning of government (fiscal responsibility, regulatory efforts, open markets, transparency or corruption)
	* Freedom of Expression and Belief
	* Association/Organization Rights
	* Rule of Law
* Examples:

| Nation | [Human Development Index (HDI)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) | [GDP/GDP per Capita/Gini ](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) | [Freedom Score](https://freedomhouse.org/) | 
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| United Kingdom | .932 (rank 13) democratic government | 40,284.64 USD per capita Gini: 73.2% 2.7 trillion | 78.4 / 100 7th - score improved when regional gov't of Northern Ireland resumed treaty in 2020 - finalized EU departure | 
| Nigeria | .539 | GDP: 432.3 billion USD $ 2,562.19 per capita | 45/100 |
| Mexico | .779 | $2.3 trillion, Decreased .3%, AND $17,000 per capita | 60/100 | 
| Russia | HDI: .824 (High Human Development Category) Ranked 52nd out of 189 countries and territories 12.1% increase from 1990 to 2019 (.735 - .834) | Raw GDP: $4.328 trillion (6th), Per capita: $29,485 (55th), Gini: 40.9% | 20/100 (144th) |
| Iran | .783 | GPD 191.7 billion USD Per capita 6,980.74 | 16/100 | 
| China | .761 | GDP $14.72 trillion USD Per capita $9,020.00 | 9/100 |

### Development and economic liberalization 

Transition to less government involvement in economy

## Supranational organization

* Globalization and international organization
* E.g. NATO, EU, UN, OPEC
* Give up national sovereignty
* Foreign Direct Investment - how much does a country's economy depend on foreign investment

## What characterizes democracies?

| Elements of democracy | Elements not necessarily of democracy |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Cooperation e.g. peaceful transition of power | Free/open/unregulated markets | 
| Free (i.e. no intimidation) and fair (i.e. no fraud) elections | Arbritrary regular elections | 
| Open public realm and public forum | Social safety net/civil society/government help |
| Representatives listen to their constituents | Efficient government |
| Majoritan rule with protection of minorities | High rate of development |

### Terms

* **Political systems** comprise the laws, ideas, and procedures that decide what government is and what government does
* **States** are political institutions that combine a permanent population with governing institutiotns that exercise control over an internationally-recognized territory
* A **nation** is a non-concrete group formed by people with common identities
	* A state _can_ have a national identity, but there are nations that are not a state, and states can include multiple nations
* A **regime** is the fundamental rules decide how power exercises
* **Government** is the set of institutions or individuals legally empowered to make binding decisions for a state
* **Sovereignty** is the right to self-rule

### A study of political systems

* China's political system is an **authoritarian regime**
* Iran's political systems is a **theocracy** with semi-democratic elements
* Nigeria's political system has existed as a constitutional presidential democracy with a federal system since 1999
* Mexico's political system has existed as a constitutional presidential democracy since 1917
* Russia's political system is theoretically a federalist democracy but has authoritarian elements
* The UK is technically a constitutional monarchy but a democracy in practice, with no separation of power

### Nations vs. States

#### Addressing nations and ethnic minorities

* Countries can deal with nationalist movements and separatist movements in several ways
* War/suppression of dissent/violence/ethnic cleansing
* Assimilation
* Vote/referendum on independence
* Devolution/granting partial autonomy/federalism
* Allow for self-rule/representation

## Democracy

### Terms

* **Democracy** or **authoritarianism** of states can be determined by:
	* Rule of law - is the state governed by law or by arbritrary decree?
	* **Government transparency** - do the citizens know what the government is doing? 
	* **Free and fair elections** - are elections competitive and opposition parties able to have a chance?
	* **Independence of government branches** - is one branch able to control all government power?
* Types of democracy
	* **Consolidated democracies** are fully democratic and have established democracies in such a way that they are unlikely to become undemocratic
	* **Transitional democracies** are democratic but still need democratic improvement
	* **Hybrid regimes** have some democratic elements but are generally undemocratic
	* **Iliberal democracies** and **hybrid regimes** are states that hold elections from time to time with little competition toward the ruling party
	* **One party states** prevent any other party from competing in elections
	* **Theocracies** require the state be controlled by leaders of a particular religion (Iran)
	* **Totalitarian governments** severely limit citizens’ rights to movement and free choice of employment
	* **Military regimes** are when military leaders hold top positions of governing authority (common in Nigeria from independence through 1999 constitution)

## In Detail: Putin

### Overview of Putin

- Early 1990s Russia was an experiment in democracy, Boris Yeltsin (progressive politician) tries to fully democratize Russia
- Yeltsin in 1999 - asks people for forgiveness, feels he has failed to do a good job as president, decided to resign and let Putin take the presidency
- Putin - tries to be the anti-Yeltsin, cold, indifferent, dominating, strong, dignified leader
- Clinton warns Yeltsin - _"This young man...he doesn't have democracy in his heart"_
- Later Yeltsin regretted his choice of successor in Putin
- Putin's first few months
  - Solidify his power and make himself known and feared
  - Wanted to "make Russia great again" after Russia's humiliation by the US (or so he perceived)
  - Putin sees the US as a threat to the stability of his regime, and thinks the US wants to overthrow him.

### Putin's resentment of the US

- He was trained in the KGB (wanted to be a secret agent all his life), which drilled the officers with an anti-US ideology
- Placed counterintelligence operations
- But was very disappointed when he was assigned to a post in Dresden in East Germany - a backwater in the Soviet Union
- There he observed the fall of the Berlin Wall - marks the waning power of the USSR, and a horrifying event to Putin
  - His world was crumbling before his eyes
  - Waning power of the USSR compared to the rising power of the US aggrieved Putin, reinforced his feelings
- Putin was confronting a crowd of protestors that were demonstrating at the KGB building where he was stationed
  - He calls Moscow, Moscow doesn't respond
  - This is a massive, massive trauma for him, because soviet influence is collapsing before his eyes, and the country he felt pride for was close to destruction
- To Putin, the end of the USSR was a humiliation, caused by the US
  - In his own words "the collapse of the USSR was the greatest geopoltical catastrophe of the century"
- He returned to the new Russia, becoming a political operative and a bureaucrat
  - Rises through the ranks working in the Kremlin
  - Gets to know Yeltsin
  - Becomes new head of the FSB (federal security service, basically the intelligence service of Russia)
  - Convinces (essentially lied to) Yeltsin that he shared his democratic goals
- Less than 1 month into his tenure as prime minister of Russia, there are the bombings in Chechnya
  - Putin goes on national television and outlines an aggressive strategy for hunting the terrorists
  - He orders military intervention to crush the Chechen separatists and goes down to the ground to observe troops
  - He is seen by the Russian public as a man of action
- He becomes president of Russia when Yeltsin resigns and immediately begins to consolidate power
  - Putin crushes opposition media outlets
  - He makes sure RT (the main state-run news agency watched by the majority of Russians) portrayed him well
  - In foreign policy, he courts the new Republican President George W. Bush
  - He knew that President Bush was very religious, and so he relates to him over religion to win him over
  - But then came 9/11, and Bush's presidency was transformed
  - Bush would respond with an anti-terrorism, pro-democracy message
  - In Iraq, Bush championed regime change and made it his mission to spread democracy worldwide with US military force and might, echoing its actions in the final days of the USSR
- Putin knows from Iraq that at some point, regime change will come to him too
  - It becomes his greatest fear and an existential threat
  - He concluded that the US would eventually use its power and leverage to depose any leader they didn't agree with, including Putin
- So Putin starts spreading an anti-American message
  - He becomes the person portrayed as "standing up" to the US to the Russian people
- In 2004, Putin gets his chance
  - Chechen terrorists take 1,100 students and teachers hostage and kill 333 of them, the worst school shooting ever
  - They demanded that Putin either withdraw his troops or they would kill the children
  - Putin deploys the army and shells the school with flamethrowers and artillery, causing massive fires and explosions, and leaving hundreds of children dead
  - There was massive domestic outrage against Putin
  - But in Putin's announcement, he blamed the West for supporting the Chechen terrorists and diverts responsibility
  - He used the threat of the US to justify more consolidation of power, including cancelling elections and firing dissenting politicians
- In the later half of the mid-2000s, popular democracy movements (so-called "color revolutions") spread throughout former Soviet republics in Europe
  - Putin thought that these movements were sparked by America in their push to export democracy around the world
  - And he concluded that these were efforts by the US to install anti-Russian and pro-American regimes under the veneer of democracy
  - Most of all, he feared Russia was next in line for revolution
    - And if there is a revolution in Russia, then Putin fears he will be overthrown, too
  - Of course, the allegations of US involvement were completely unfounded (Washington has never sought to overthrow him), but to Putin, they just vindicated his belief that the US was an enemy
  - To Putin, enough was enough, and he started to plan his revenge
- At the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Putin agggressively bashes Western leaders for the US's "almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations"
  - This was a turning point for Putin
  - He showed his true colors
  - He was basically saying, "we aren't going to even try anymore, from now on, the US will abide by our rules"
  - The Bush administration could do nothing to turn Putin back
- In 2008, Obama became president
  - Obama wished to build a constructive relationship with Putin with his new foreign policy
  - He initiated a "reset" of Russian-American relations
- In 2009 Obama personally came over to Russia for a visit
So everything Putin does is out of revenge for the US
  - Putin spoke to Obama with an "airing of grievances" - essentially complaining about everything he doesn't like about the US
  - Obama is very clear that Putin is (in his mind) locked in the past and won't accept being a partner of the US
  - Putin eventually came to believe that Obama was just as bad as the previous US presidents
  - He is vindicated by the Arab Spring, which is (to him) like experiencing the Dresden demonstrations of 1989 again
  - He sees it as the American meddling in the internal affairs of other countries to the detriment of Russia
  - And Putin saw the Arab Spring as something that could happen to Russia and could personally happen to him
- By 2011, protests against Putin began
  - The largest demonstration in Russa since 1991
  - The protests were against mass-scale electoral fraud in the 2011 elections
  - Putin sees American regime change coming to Russia
  - And he blames it on Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, who was outspokenly in favor of the protestors
  - Putin claimed that behind the scenes, Clinton was funding the Russian opposition and sparked the protests
  - He ordered a crackdown on the protests
  - And from that point on he remembers Clinton as an adversary and personally wishes to exact revenge on her
  - In Putin's mind, he was defending Russia's (and his own) survival against the US

### Russian interference in 2016 elections

## Democratization

| Country | Competition and fairness in elections | Citizen participation in policy-making process | Governmental Transparency | Protected civil liberties and protection for minority groups | "Rule of law" is reality | Alternation of power based on election results and independence of branches | Authoritarian Regime, Hybrid/Transitional Democracy, or Consolidated Democracy? Explain briefly |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|
| UK | Yes, the UK has fully free and fair elections | Yes, political participation is high and the citizenry is active | Yes, there is no major issue, though political favors to private companies have increased in recent years | Yes, minorities are relatively well protected in the UK. However, there are sparse occurrences of terrorist attacks. | Yes, rule of law is consistently exercised, though recent acts have made this more tenuous. | Yes, though there is no separation of powers (supreme power is in the legislature) | Consolidated democracy. The UK has all the elements of a functioning and thriving democracy. |
| Nigeria | Yes, the elections are competitive, but are not always free and fair | Yes, but there are still numerous obstacles towards full participation | No, the government is routinely non-transparent and corrupt | No, minorities continue to be harassed. | No, rule of law has started, but not been established | Yes, though the largest parties still hold most power | Transitional democracy. Nigeria is clearly democratic, but needs further refinement of its democratic process. |
| Russia | No, power is concentrated in Putin and his party | No, political participation is low and mistrust of government is high | No, there is frequent government corruption | No, minorities continue to be harassed. | No, the political system is still "might makes right" | No, the current party and president has remained the same for the past | Authoritarian regime. "Democracy" is just a veneer to grant Putin legitimacy |
| Mexico | Yes, elections are competitive, but not always free | Yes, but there are still numerous obstacles towards full participation | No, there is overwhelming government corruption and fraud | Yes, there are programs to protect minorities, but these are not enough | Yes, but rule of law is very preliminary, and has yet to take full hold. | Yes, there is frequent alternation of power, though opposition parties are still at a disadvantage | Transitional democracy. Mexico is clearly democratic, but needs further refinement of its democratic process. |
| Iran | Yes, elections are held regularly, but they are neither free nor fair | No, only people loyal to the establishment can participate | No, corruptioon is endemic, despite efforts to tackle it | No, very few minorities are officially recognized, and other minorities are suppressed | No, basic rule of law is regularly violated for political favors | No, while there is some room for shifts of power, these are few | Hybrid regime. While Iran holds regular elections, the elections benefit the regime only. |
| China | No, there are no elections. | No, there is no political participation. | No, corruption is endemic, and efforts to reduce it have ended badly. | No, minorities are routinely suppressed. | No, basic rule of law is shelved on a whim by the ruling party. | No, there has never been an alternation of power in 70 years | Authoritarian regime. China is entirely undemocratic. |
