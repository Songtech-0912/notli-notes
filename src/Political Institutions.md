# Political Institutions

_This is the second unit of the AP Comparative Politics Course_

## Nigeria: transitional democracy

### State Structure

* 1st republic - parliamentary democracy
* Second republic 1979 (US-like system)
* Third republic was supposed to happen after military dictatorships, but never happened
* Fourth republic - slightly modified presidential model
	* Strong executive
	* Bicameral legislature - House of Representatives and Senate
	* Independent judiciary
	* Constitutional rule of law

### Skewed Federalism

* Federalism _de jure_ but not really _de facto_
* Funding is controlled by the federal government - with _fiscal federalism_ as all oil and gas is property of the federal government

### Issues with the institutions

- The executive reigns supreme over the legislative and judiciary
- Historically, Nigerian presidents have consolidated their power

### Social Cleavages

- The north is predominantly Muslim and the south is predominantly Christian
- Under Nigeria's system, there are religious Sharia law courts that individuals may choose to use instead of the secular law courts system
- Nigeria is composed of many ethnic groups, but the three biggest ones are Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, which also dominate national politics, at the expense of other ethnic groups
- Boko Haram (a terrorist islamist group) is causing a major insurgency within the northeastern regions and has been a major issue for the past two decades

### Corruption

- **Clientelism** dominates Nigerian politics - using state funds to keep oneself in office
- Just like the US in the 1890s, wealthy and powerful patrons fund candidates to get into office, and successful candidates then accede to the demands and whims of their patrons
- There is a lot of money in Nigeria, but it is poorly distributed

## Mexico: transitional democracy

### State Structure

- 1910 revolution and 1917 constitution
- State corporatism with single-party rule until the 2000s
- Now a multiparty democracy
	- Bicameral legislature - Chamber of Deputies and Senate
	- President with one six-year term
	- Strong executive branch but with local states and governments
	- Gender quota (30% women candidates) for Congress since 2002
