# Political Ideology

## Political Culture

* Short definition: A shared set of values or beliefs
* Longer definition: A sustained way of thinking in how political and economic life (government) ought to be carried out

### Distinctly American Characteristics of Political Culture

* Diversity
* Healthy competition
* Religion
* Egalitarianism
* Individualism
* Equality of opportunity
* Freedom
* Free enterprise
* Rule of law
* Limited government

### Polling

* Polling on Americans reflect that most believe in shared ideals, yet differ in the interpretation of these ideals
* It's also typically the case that most Americans believe that American ideals (e.g. democracy, freedom, equality) are important, but few believe that the ideals are reflected in real life
* Unfortunately, Americans are heavily politically polarized; large majorities of Democrats and Republicans view the other party unfavorably
* It is typically in the aftermath of traumatic events and/or a common enemy (e.g. Pearl Harbor, 9/11 attacks) that serve as a catalyst to unite us

#### Important factors of polling effectiveness

* Good samples
	* Random
	* Specific time
	* Proportional
	* Large enough sample size of ~800-1000 people (problem due to inequality of access, low response rates, and price)
* Type of poll (internet v. live caller v. IVR poll v. landline v. cell phone)
* Language barrier
* Who picks up the phone? (typically more politically active voters, which skews data)
* Dealing with bias in demographics (e.g. underrepresented groups)
* The skills of interviewers/pollsters (and their education and background)
* Questions
	* Order of questions
	* Consistency
	* How a question is worded

#### Types of Poll

* Opinion Polls
	* Benchmark Polls
		* Poll to gauge support of potential run of a cnadidate
		* **Focus groups** are good for this
	* Entrance Polls
		* Poll taken before voters cast their ballot
	* Exti Polls
		* Poll taken right after voters cast their ballot

#### Focus Groups

A focus group is a group interview involving a small number of demographically different participants to find their reactions.

### Traditional Agents of Political Socialization

Political beliefs are often influenced by:
* Religion
* Family
* Peers
* Education/geography
* Media (News/social media)

### Changes in Political Socialization

- Religion is generally less significant in the lives of younger voters - secularism is increasing
- "Traditional" v. "modern" values can drive political ideology and culture
- Progress is often a conflict of traditional v. modern values
- The percieved decline and/or threat of religion causes more to cling tightly to it, and this is often used by politicians to win votes

### Political Climate

Note that political climate is **not** the same as political culture! Political climate is the measure of the general mood and opinions of society at a certain time.

We often say that political climate was far less polarized and more civil previously. The tendency to disagree without being disagreeable was much greater previously.

## Influences of political ideology

* Generational effects: the Great Depression, World War II, Cold War, and other historical events have greatly influenced voters
* Political events: e.g. the Watergate Scandal
* Lifecycle effects: e.g. student debt, taxes for businesses, arrest by police, etc

### Examples of major influences on the current generation
* Generational
	* Social media
	* Technology
	* COVID-19
	* School shootings
	* Global warming/climate change/environmental issues

	* Capitol riots (Jan 6th)
	* 2020 elections/Trump
	* Obama/Obamacare
	* Immigration crises
	* Texas abortion law
	* BLM/police brutality/racial inequality
* Lifecycle
	* Masks/vaccine
	* Education

### Social Cleavages

Social cleavages are differences in political alignments of certain social groups. They can divide groups that would otherwise be united, causing factionalism.

Example:
* Religion
* Education
* Social Class
* Race
* Gender
* Urban/rural/etc.

## Efficacy

**Efficacy** is the faith and belief that citizens feel towards their government

* Internal: believes that a person can make an impact on the political system
* External: believes the government is responsive to the people's needs
