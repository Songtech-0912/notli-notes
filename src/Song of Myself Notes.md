Jacky Song

## Big Picture

  * He often incorporates ideas that his wandering mind stumbles upon

  * It is a freeing and independent style, unconstrained, which creates a distinctly American style of poetry

  * Celebration of self, the individual
  * It is okay, even useful to be nonconformist
  * Celelbration of what makes us uniquely American

## Quotes

> "And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
> And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
> And of these one and all I weave the song of myself."

> "I help myself to material and immaterial,
> No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me."

## Detailed Analysis

### Essential Themes

* Transcendent power of love, brotherhood, and comradeship
* The myriad connection underlying all things
* Imaginative projection into others' lives
* Optimistic faith in democracy and equality
* Belief in the regnerative and illustrative powers of nature and its value as a teahcer
* Equivalence of body and soul and the unabashed exaltation of the body (including sexuality)

### Poetic Techniques

* Free verse: lack of metrical regularity and conventional rhyme, completely unrestricted
Use of repeated images, symbols, phrases, and grammatical units
* Use of enumerations and catalogs
* Use of anaphora (initial repetition) in lines, and ephanaphora between lines
* Contrast and parallelism in paired lines
* Thus, he paves the way for a truly "American" way of writing - free, individualist, plain, irreverent, expressive

### Use of Language

* Idiosyncratic spelling and punctuation
* Words used for their sounds as much as their sense; foreign feel
* Uses specialized words, including words from other languages, nautical terms, scientific terms, business terms, carpentry terms, etc.

### Imagery

* When first published, Whitman was described as obscene for its over sexuality
* However, it is more likely that Whitman sought to simply clear sexuality from its traditionally sinful-perceived nature
* Whitman equates the passion and joy in sexuality in other areas of life and nature
* And Whitman is trying to grapple with his individualism in a very shunning society

### Purpose

* _"All men live lives of quiet desperation"_ -> by Henry Thoreau, one of Whitman's contemporaries
* Whitman's writing is a rebellion against the rigid moral norms and standards of society, preferring a world in which all things are holy and good and worthy of love
