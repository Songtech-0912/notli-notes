# "Song of Myself" Notes

Jacky Song

## Big Picture

* Whitman wants you to "enjoy the moment you're in"
  * He often incorporates ideas that his wandering mind stumbles upon
* He isn't interested in the formality or style of his poem
  * It is a freeing and independent style, unconstrained, which creates a distinctly American style of poetry

## Who is Whitman?

* "Working-man poet" style
* One of the transcendentalists
  * Celebration of self, the individual
  * It is okay, even useful to be nonconformist
  * Celelbration of what makes us uniquely American
  * Glorifies nature
  * Transcendence - we are meant to leave ("transcend") the physical body and connect and become one with the universe
    * For knowledge
    * For self-exploration
    * For inner peace
  * Self-reliance and free thought
  * Celebrates the common, everyday people
    
      
## Quotes

> "And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
> And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
> And of these one and all I weave the song of myself."

> "I help myself to material and immaterial,
> No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me."

## Detailed Analysis

### Essential Themes

* Transcendent power of love, brotherhood, and comradeship
* The myriad connection underlying all things
* Imaginative projection into others' lives
* Optimistic faith in democracy and equality
* Belief in the regnerative and illustrative powers of nature and its value as a teahcer
* Equivalence of body and soul and the unabashed exaltation of the body (including sexuality)

### Poetic Techniques

* Free verse: lack of metrical regularity and conventional rhyme, completely unrestricted
Use of repeated images, symbols, phrases, and grammatical units
* Use of enumerations and catalogs
* Use of anaphora (initial repetition) in lines, and ephanaphora between lines
* Contrast and parallelism in paired lines
* Thus, he paves the way for a truly "American" way of writing - free, individualist, plain, irreverent, expressive

### Use of Language

* Idiosyncratic spelling and punctuation
* Words used for their sounds as much as their sense; foreign feel
* Uses specialized words, including words from other languages, nautical terms, scientific terms, business terms, carpentry terms, etc.

### Imagery

* When first published, Whitman was described as obscene for its over sexuality
* However, it is more likely that Whitman sought to simply clear sexuality from its traditionally sinful-perceived nature
* Whitman equates the passion and joy in sexuality in other areas of life and nature
* And Whitman is trying to grapple with his individualism in a very shunning society

### Purpose

* _"All men live lives of quiet desperation"_ -> by Henry Thoreau, one of Whitman's contemporaries
* Whitman's writing is a rebellion against the rigid moral norms and standards of society, preferring a world in which all things are holy and good and worthy of love

## Connected pieces

### _Self Reliance_ by Ralph Waldo Emerson

(Port notes from notebook)

> "There is a time...that [every man] arrives at the conviction that **envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide**"
* You're not supposed to be like or do things like someone else: doing so is a suicide of the self; instead, you should be who you are
* Being someone we are not is just as damaging to the soul as suicide
> "Whoso would be a man, must be a **nonconformist**...nothing is at last sacred but the **integrity of your own mind**"
* Emerson sees it necessary to not bow to any pressure or influence from others; more simply, you've got to follow yourself, and your independence is what's most imporant
* Here comes the paradox though: what happens if you use your own power to act against society? What prevents you from taking individualism too far?
* Thus, there has to be a balancing act where we set _limits_ on the importance of the individual
> "No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature...the only right is what is after my constitution"
* Conscience comes from the self, not from the labels of "good" and "bad" from other people
* However, we could justify nearly any action by the adage "it's good because works for me" (self-serving), including societally unacceptable things
> "What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think"
* Essentially: others' opinions don't matter: if there is something that I feel is right, I need to do it
> "...but the great man is he who in the midst of the crow keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude..."
* The great man is great because he can live among others peacefully, but still follow their inner compass
* Whereas many others would deliberately ignore their own judgement and evidence and join in with the crowd

#### Key ideas

* According Emerson, we should always try to forge our own path instead of copying someone else
* Conformity is not a virtue, it is a hindrance, and thus society has an adverse effect on people's growth
* In other words, Emerson believed through working on ourselves, we grow to be self-reliant to the point that we no longer envy others, but measure ourself against only ourselves
* When we become self-reliant, we focus on creating, rather than imitating

#### Responses to the concept of "self-reliance"

* NY Times - ["The Foul Reign of Emerson's 'self-reliance'"](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/magazine/riff-ralph-waldo-emerson.html) - some quotes:
	* "The 'excessive love' of individual liberty over national unity"
	* "The 'plague of devices' that keep us staring into the shallow puddle of our dopamine reactions [as verification of our own self-importance]"
	* "...Our fetish for....the American afflication of ignoring volumes of evidence in favor of flashes that meet the eye"
	* Idea: we've been taught to be self-interested so much that we forget the importance of the things that matter
	* Emerson's thinking allowed us to lose the value of the real world
	* "The larger problem with the essay...has been Emerson's tacit endorsement of a radically self-centered worldview" - that is, Emerson allows us having a self-centered worldview
