## Political Participation throughout history

| Amendment | Summarize Amendment | Historical Context | Significance of Amendment | 
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| [15th](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xv) | Prohibits denial of the franchise on account of race | Reconstruction; Southern states attempted to restrict franchise using voting tax/literacy tests/etc. Republican-controlled Congress attempted to mitigate these issues | Established a brief period (~15 years) where African Americans were able to vote consistently; first black senators; removal of barriers to vote | 
| [17th](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) | Provides for the popular election of senators | Late 19th - early 20th century; political machines allowed party bosses to control state legislatures so as to appoint their favored representatives | Increased participation in elections for the Senate; stopped state legislatures from having control over their senators; reducing the accountability of state legislatures |
| [19th](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xix) | Prohibits denial of franchise on account of sex | Women's rights movement; notion that half of the population was barred from the franchise | Established that women were granted the right to vote under the Constitution |
| [24th](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxiv) | Protects all people from being denied their right to vote due to poll taxes | In many southern states after the 15th amendment was passed, poll taxes were reintroduced, along with literacy tests and other measures as a way of undermining the amendment | Protected citizens right to vote by eliminating poll taxes that might make it difficult for them to vote |
| [26th](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxvi) | Grants the right to vote for American citizens of the age 18 or older.  | In most states, the voting age was 21 and older, but in the Vietnam war many 18-20 year olds were getting drafted, so people called for the voting age to be lowered to 18+ | Extending the right to vote, established more young people with the ability of shaping the US (voting).  |


## Ways to increase political participation

* Election Day as national holiday
* Require voters to vote by law
* Improve civic and political education -> improves interest and efficacy
* Incentives -> monetary compensation for election
* Better candidates
* Voter drives, motor voter, electronic vote, mail-in vote -> simplifying the voting process
* Free transporation to vote + polls everywhere especially in rural areas

## Political parties

* Political parties, interest groups, and social movements are **linkage institutions**: channels that allow individuals to pariticiplate in the policy-making process, and influence how people relate to government
* Political parties are:
	* A label in voters' minds
		* Crafts a message that appeals to them
	* An organization
	* A set of leaders
* The **functions** of political parties include:
	* Mobilization and (political) education to influence voters
	* Party platforms
	* Candidate recruitment (cultivating a candidate to win and represent the party, and getting them to follow party line)
	* Campaign management, including fundraising and media strategy
	* The committee and party leadership systems in legislatures (e.g. in Congress)

### Techniques used by political parties
* Canvassing
	* Direct contact with people (knock on doors)
	* Get out vote drives
	* Campaigns
	* Awareness efforts

### Structures of political parties
* National-level
* State-level
* Local-level

### Can a candidate "be" the party?
* The nominees of a poltical party are nominally also representatives of it
* But this is not necessarily true

## Power and Influence of Political Parties
* Senators can be incentivized to pass bills in line with their party agendas
* And parties can make sure senators fall in line and/or stay silent; otherwise, political suicide!

## Party platforms

### Republican Platform
* Pro-life
* Small government
* For stronger national defense and a more hawkish foreign policy
* Deregulation
* Lower taxes
* Harsh stance on illegal immigration + immigration restriction
* Capitalism/free markets/pro-business
* Pro-death penalty, hard on crime

### Democratic Platform

## Party change and adaptation

* Parties have adapted to candidate-centered campaigns, and their role in nominating candidates has been weakened
* Parties use communication technology and voter data management to disseminate, control, and clarify political messages and enhance outreach and mobilization efforts.
* Parties modify their policies and messaging to reach out to various demographical coalitions
* Party structure can be changed by:
	* Critical elections and regional realignments
	- Campaign finance law
	- Changes in communication and data management technology

### Critical elections and Party realignment

* **Critical Elections** - an electoral "earthquake" where new issues and coalitions emerge
* **Party Realignment** - the _lasting_ displacement of the majority party by the minority party, often during or just after a critical election (e.g. the New Deal coalition in 1932). This is usually involves:
	* Conversion -> existing voters switch parties OR
	* Mobilization -> new voters come into the electorate and choose a party overwhelmingly

## Structural Barriers and Third Parties

### Why are third-parties disadvantaged?

* In comparison to proportional systems, winner-take-all voting districts serve as a **structural barrier** to third-party and independent candidate success
* The absorption of third-party agendas into platforms of major political parties serves as another **structural barrier** to third parties

### Structural Barrier 1: Voting system

* "First past the post" or "winner takes all" systems just require a majority to win:
	* One vote per citizen
	* Candidate for most votes win
* Single member distincts (voting by districts only)
	* Encourages party umbrella to get more people 
	- Discourages minor/third parties
* Issues with first past the post:
	* Minority rule -> doesn't need a majority to win
	* Results in an inevitable two-party system
	* The spoiler effect -> the better a third-party system does, the more it detracts from the party that the third-party voters most identify with
	* The system is polarized and doesn't allow for nuance

## The Media as a Linkage Institution

* All presidents need to interact with the media
* Media can influence policy-making
* However, this leads to controversy:
	* Factual and opinionated statements can be hard to destinguish
	* Lack of digital literacy can lead to fake institutions portraying themselves as reliable sources
	* People typically tend to overly trust the same media sources and not let their views be challenged
	* Media channels can be too focused on viewership (and money) and not on actual facts

### Roles of the media

* The **Gatekeeper** - telling people what info's important
	* But do they over- or under-stress the importance of an issue?
* The **Watchdog** - keeps the government accountable ("tough journalism", muckraking, leaking government reports of corruption/abuses of power)
	* But do they hold all politicians _equally_ accountable?
* The **Scorekeeper** - reports on elections, races, pollings, rivalries ("horse-race politics")
* The **Entertainer** - commentary about headlines ("yellow journalism")

## Biases
* A good overview of common biases is available [here](http://archive.mrc.org/books/identifybias.asp](http://archive.mrc.org/books/identifybias.asp)

## Rules Governing the Media
* Newspapers - least government regulation
* Radio and TV (but **not** cable news!) - most government regulation (FCC-regulated, can revoke operating license)
	* "Fairness doctrine" - fair and balanced coverage of controversial issues, abolished in 2011
	* "Right of reply" - allows a person who is attacked on a braodcase to respond to the attack
	* "Equal-time rule" - equal access for all candidates
* Confidentially of Sources (reporters don't have to reveal their source, "anonymous sources")
* Broadcasting - regulated
* The Internet - no regulation at all

## Interest Groups and their influence on policy making

**Interest groups**: groups of people who come together in order to get policies they favor enacted.

### Roles
* Educate voters and office holders
* Conduct lobbying
* Draft legislation
* Mobilize membership to apply pressure on and work with legislators

### Why Join an Interest Group?
* **Solidarity incentive**: social benefits like companionship and being with like-minded people
* **Material incentives**: money, or things worth money
* **Purposive incentives**: reward is serving a purpose

### Interest Group Influence
* **Political Cue**: signal that tells legislator or public how to feel about a certain issue
* **Ratings**: "assessment" of a representative's voting record on relevant issues
* **Amicus Curiae brief** (for SCOTUS)

### Endorsements
* Endorsements from **well-connected** or **a large number** of interest groups provide informative signals to members of Congress reviewing legislation
* The value of this signal can be significant in the later stages of the legislative 
* Big interest groups have huge leverage with their endorsements

### Lobbying

* In the broadest possible sense, lobbying is petitioning a politician or a group of people to vote in a certain way
* This could be done by private citizens, but also by paid professionals
	* Can be beneficial or malicious
	* But it can be easily abused: e.g. Private sector CEOs can often lobby for legislation that can make their lives easier later
	* Lobbying can be a professional boon for politicians to get legislation through
