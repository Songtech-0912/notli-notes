# Energy

**Energy** is most simply the ability to force something to move
**Mechanical energy** is the energy that is due to motion or due to its position.
*Remember: energy is independent from momentum: they are different things.*

## Types of Energy

* Kinetic energy is the energy of motion
* Potential energy is energy due to position
	* E.g. graviational potential energy, electrical potential energy

## Changes in Energy

* Gravitational potential energy is directly dependent on mass, height, and the strength of the gravitational field (which is constant on Earth)
* Kinetic energy is directly dependent on mass and the object's velocity

## Conservation of Energy

* The **conservation of energy** states that in an isolated system, the total amount of energy is conserved
	* Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be stored and transferred
	* In such a perfectly isolated system, no energy is exchanged with objects outside of the system
	* Because there are no perfectly isolated systems in reality, in practice, we just define a system as isolated within certain spacial boundaries (e.g. "my system is defined as everything on and around the Earth")
	* Your decision of what _is_ and _isn't_ in a system are arbritrary - you can include or exclude as many things from it as you want
* According to the conservation of energy, any **increase** in one type of energy is coupled with a **decrease** in all the other types of energy

## Work

* **Work** is a transfer of energy by a force applied along a displacement
* Tricky points:
	* The displacement has to be _parallel_ to the force applied, or else it isn't work!
	* The force and displacement can be both in the same and opposite directions
* Work is given by the equation:

$$
W = F\Delta x
$$

* When the force and the displacement are in the same direction, the work is positive
* When the force and the displacement are in opposite directions, the work is positive
* Based on the conservation of energy, the sum of work in a system is zero

## Modelling energy in a system at macroscopic scales

* First, list the objects that are part of the system, and the objects that are not part of the system
	* E.g. if your hypothetical system is the solar system, you'd be listing all the planets, asteroids, rocks, gas clouds, etc. (all the interacting things within the solar system's boundaries)
	* Meanwhile, if your hypothetical system was the school, you'd be listing all the students, teachers, classrooms, books, etc.
	* ***You*** decide what is part of the system, the choice of what to include is arbritrary
	* While not required, we typically assume the system to be frictionless
* Then, we measure the energy in the system at two positions, the initial and final position
	* The first bar graph is the storage of energy at one point in the system
	* The second bar graph is the storage of energy at another point in the system
	* Remember, energy is the same thing at every point in the system, it just manifests itself in different forms
		* The different types of energy are its modes of storage
		* E.g. kinetic energy is the kinetic storage of energy, elastic potential energy is
		* Within the system, energy can be transferred
* It's an "L-O-L" diagram!

### Modelling friction in the system

We can model friction (or any other force that does negative force) in a system in two ways:

* We could say that the energy is converted and stored in a different form (heat + sound, or what we call "dissipated energy") in the system
* But we could also say that friction is an _external force_ and causes energy to leave the system

## Work done by a force at an angle

**Work** is more accurately the energy transferred by a force, by the component of the force that is parallel to the direction of displacement. Since a force can be at an angle, we must find only the portion of the force.

$$
W = F \Delta x \cos \theta
$$

If the angle between the direction of displacement and the direction of the force is zero, then $\cos \theta = 1$ so $W = F \Delta x$

## Energy at the molecular level

Energy "lost" is often called dissipated, internal, or thermal energy. Here, energy is stored as **changes in motion and position** at the molecular level that manifest as changes in temperature at the macroscopic level. There is only potential energy and kinetic energy at the microscopic level; concepts such as "thermal energy" disappear.

Temperature is a measure of the **average kinetic energy** of the molecules of a substance.

## Power and energy transfer

**Power** is the rate at which work is done:

$$
P = \frac{W}{t}
$$

Unit is Watt (that is, joules per second)

(Note: more generally: power is the rate of energy transfer per second)
