# Energy

**Energy** is most simply the ability to force something to move.
**Mechanical energy** is the energy that is due to motion or due to its position.
*Remember: energy is independent from momentum: they are different things.*

## Types of Energy

* Kinetic energy is the energy of motion
* Potential energy is energy due to position
	* E.g. graviational potential energy, electrical potential energy

## Changes in Energy

* Gravitational potential energy is directly dependent on mass, height, and the strength of the gravitational field (which is constant on Earth)
* Kinetic energy is directly dependent on mass and the object's velocity

## Conservation of Energy

* The **conservation of energy** states that in an isolated system, the total amount of energy is conserved
	* Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred
	* In such a perfectly isolated system, no energy is exchanged with objects outside of the system
	* Because there are no perfectly isolated systems in reality, in practice, we just define a system as isolated within certain spacial boundaries (e.g. "my system is defined as everything on and around the Earth")
	* Your decision of what _is_ and _isn't_ in a system are arbritrary - you can include or exclude as many things from it as you want
* According to the conservation of energy, any **increase** in one type of energy is coupled with a **decrease** in all the other types of energy

## Work

* **Work** is a transfer of energy by a force applied along a displacement
* Tricky points:
	* The displacement has to be _parallel_ to the force applied, or else it isn't work!
	* The force and displacement can be both in the same and opposite directions
* Work is given by the equation:

$$
W = F\Delta x
$$

* When the force and the displacement are in the same direction, the work is positive
* When the force and the displacement are in opposite directions, the work is positive
* Based on the conservation of energy, the sum of work in a system is zero
